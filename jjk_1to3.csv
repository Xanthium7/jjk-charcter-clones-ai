Gojou,Good morning.
Itadori,Ah… Ugh… Ngh…
[Action: Itadori raises his head and looks around.],
Itadori,"Huh?

Ugh… Ugh…"
Gojou,So which one of the two are you right now?
Itadori,"Hey, wait… Aren’t you…"
Gojou,Satoru Gojou. I’m head of the first-years at Jujutsu High.
Itadori,Jujutsu? Fushiguro… Where is he?!
[Action: Itadori lurches forward but can’t move.],
Itadori,Huh?
[Action: Itadori notices that he’s tied down.],
Itadori,What the hell is this?
Gojou,"I wouldn’t be worrying about others right now, Yuuji Itadori."
Itadori,Ah…
Gojou,"You see, it’s been decided that you’re to be secretly executed."

"[Scene: In the past, at Itadori’s house. Itadori calls Sugisawa Hospital.]",
Nurse 1,Sugisawa Hospital.
Itadori,"This is Yuuji Itadori. I called earlier.

Yes. Yes. I’m sorry to keep calling, but how’s my grandpa doing?"
Nurse 1,"Huh? I thought they already told you.

Oh, nevermind. Just hold on a minute. I’ll go find out myself."
"[Action: At the hospital, the nurse goes to Wasuke’s room.]",
Nurse 2,Mr. Itadori never uses his call button.
Nurse 3,It’s kinda scary that he doesn’t.
Nurse 1,"Mr. Itadori, you have a call. It’s your grandson again, asking if you want him to bring any --"
Wasuke,Leave me alone!
Nurse 1,Ah…
Wasuke,Tell him not to come here!
Nurses,Ah…
Wasuke,He should go to his club! Go to his club!
Nurse 1,"I, uhh… I guess you probably heard that. So, what type of club are you in, Yuuji?"
Itadori,"Yeah, I heard. Thanks a lot."
,
"[Scene: At night, at Miyashiro Prefectural Sugisawa Third High School. Fushiguro is in search of a cursed object.]",
Fushiguro,They’re keeping a cursed object here in a place like this? Could they be any more stupid?
[Action: Fushiguro opens the latch to a small cabinet to find that it’s empty.],
Fushiguro,Huh… Erk!
[Action: Fushiguro searches all around the cabinet.],
Fushiguro,Ngh… Ugh… Ugh… Ngh… Ngh…!
[Action: Fushiguro calls Gojou on his phone.],
Fushiguro,There’s nothing here.
Gojou,Huh?
Fushiguro,The Stevenson hutch is empty.
Gojou,For real? That’s hilarious! Maybe it took a nighttime stroll.
Fushiguro,I’m going to punch you.
Gojou,"Well, no going home until it’s recovered, okay?"
[Action: Gojou hangs up.],
Fushiguro,I’m seriously going to punch him.
,
"[Scene: The next afternoon, at school. Itadori gathers with Iguchi and Sasaki around a ouija board for club activities.]",
Itadori,"Ready to go?

Whaddya say?

Sasaki?"
Sasaki,Mm.
Itadori,Iguchi?
Iguchi,Mmm…
Itadori,"Okay… Go!

Spirit gods, spirit gods! Which creature is the council president barely weaker than?!"
[Action: The ouija board marker begins to move.],
Group,"Oh?

Ku-ri-o-ne."
"Sasaki, Iguchi",Hahahaha!
Itadori,A sea angel’s tougher?! Aww~!
[Action: The student council president slams the door open.],
President,Occult club!
Itadori,"Hey, Plankton President! What’s up?"
Sasaki,Ughhh…
[Action: The student council president slams a paper onto the table.],
President,"As you were previously informed, a research club with no real activities must forfeit its club room.

So vacate now!"
Itadori,"You really oughta be careful not to underestimate our members, President."
"[Action: Sasaki stands up, grabs a ledger, and slams it onto the table.]",
President,And what is that?
Group,Hehe…
Sasaki,"You know about the school’s rugby field being closed off, don't you?"
President,Yes. Some of the students who got sick actually had to be hospitalized.
Sasaki,"And so you don’t find that alarming? We’re talking about some tough rugby players here.

The players said that just before they started feeling sick… they heard mysterious sounds and voices coming from the field. And then, we found this newspaper article from 30 years ago. It talks about the disappearance of a certain Mr. Yoshida, who worked for the construction company. It says he was last sighted here at Sugisawa Third High School during its construction."
President,Huh?
Sasaki,"Yoshida was struggling to make ends meet, so he turned to loan sharks, and those organizations were after him.

Which means the whole mysterious disaster at the rugby field was caused by the vengeful spirit of Yoshida, whose body is buried there!"
President,"No, actually it was just ticks.

Hard ticks to be exact. Large blood-sucking bugs. If one bites you and infects you with SFTS, it can be fatal, so you have to be careful."
Itadori,"So what if it was ticks?! The occult club is trying to uncover occult activity, so it’s still a valid activity report!"
President,"This is not some kid’s game! Besides, the biggest problem is you, Yuuji Itadori!

You’re registered with track and field, not the occult club, so this club doesn’t even have the three members required to be a club!"
Itadori,Uhhh…
Sasaki,You did that?
Itadori,But I… I’m sure I wrote Occult Club…
Takagi,I’m the one who changed it!
Itadori,Coach Takagi?! What for?
Takagi,"Because, track and field team needs you on it!"
President,(Thoughts) So says the only teacher more problematic than the students.
Itadori,How many times do I have to tell you I’m not joining the team?!
Takagi,You are!
Itadori,"No, I’m not!"
Takagi,"However, I’m not some demon. So, if you can defeat me, I’ll excuse you from the team. And we’ll settle this… fair and square by competing!"
Itadori,That’ll work! You’ve got a deal!
"Sasaki, Iguchi",Yay!
President,(Thoughts) How fair and square is it to rewrite a student’s club application?
,
[Scene: Sometime later. Fushiguro walks through the rugby field.],
Fushiguro,(Thoughts) What’s with this rugby field?
[Action: A curse swims through the ground.],
Fushiguro,"(Thoughts) Is there a dead body buried here or something?

(Thoughts) Even if there is, I’m surprised to see a cursed spirit this high level here. It looks like a grade 2 curse. Must be the influence of that cursed object.

(Thoughts) Damn… Its presence is too strong to pin down. It feels like it’s close by, but it actually could be far away.

(Thoughts) This special-grade cursed object’s a serious pain.

(Thoughts) Who could have moved it? And where is it now?"
Students,"Hey, come here! Check this out! Coach Takagi is taking on Itadori from West Middle!

Wow, what are they competing for?"
[Action: Fushiguro walks toward the field where the competition is taking place. Takagi throws a shot-put.],
Takagi,Yeah! Hmph!
Students,14 meters!
Takagi,Hahaha!
Students,"Takagi! Takagi!

Wow, Takagi’s still got it!"
Sasaki,"Wow, is he famous or something?"
Iguchi,"It’s just a rumor, but I heard that he beat all the stages of “Ninja Warrior” and that he’s the reincarnation of a Mirko Cro Cop."
Sasaki,But Mirko’s not even dead yet.
Iguchi,He earned the nickname “Tiger of West Middle”.
Sasaki,That's lame.
Itadori,"Hey, so can I throw it however I want?"
Takagi,"Mm-hm! For this challenge you can throw however you want. After all, I know this event isn’t your strong suit. You’ve probably never really been…"
Itadori,Hmph.
[Action: Itadori flings the shot-put at a soccer goal.],
Student,"Uhh, about 30 meters, I guess."
Itadori,Yes! I crushed it!
Sasaki,Kinda more gorilla than tiger.
Iguchi,He threw that like a pitcher…
Sasaki,"You’d do really well on a sports team, Itadori.

Don’t force yourself to stay in our occult club."
Itadori,"Huh? Really? But even though you love scary stuff, without me, you could never go to haunted places."
Sasaki,But we like being scared…
[Action: A group of boys begins taking pictures with Takagi.],
Itadori,School rules are I have to be in some cub. And I could never keep this up.
Sasaki,"(Flashback) You don’t have to do anything! You can be a ghost member! After all, we’re the Occult Club!"
Itadori,(Flashback) Hehe!
Sasaki,"Yeah, I did say that."
Itadori,"Besides, I want to be able to go home by 6.

So if you two don’t mind, I’ll stay. I really like being in your club. It has a great vibe."
Sasaki,"Well, in that case, we’re happy to have you back."
Iguchi,Yeah.
Sasaki,Hehehe…
Fushiguro,(Thoughts) That guy’s incredible. He pulled off that shot without using any cursed energy. I wonder if he’s like Zen’in.
Itadori,"Woah, it’s already half past 4."
[Action: Itadori grabs his backpack.],
Itadori,"Later, Coach! Got stuff to do!"
Sasaki,Gahh!
Fushiguro,Huh?
"[Action: Itadori runs past Fushiguro. As he does, Fushiguro feels a spark.]",
Fushiguro,"Ah…!

(Thoughts) The presence of a cursed object!

Hey, hold it!"
[Action: Itadori sprints off.],
Fushiguro,How is he that fast?!
Student,I heard he can run the 50 meters in 3 seconds.
Student,Faster than my car!
,
"[Scene: In the evening, at Sugisawa Hospital. Itadori visits Wasuke.]",
Wasuke,"I told you not to come!

And stop bringing flowers with you every time!"
Itadori,"You always say that, but you know these aren’t for you. They’re for the nurses."
Wasuke,All the more reason not to! What’s happening with your school club?! Why aren’t you at your club?!
Itadori,"Oh, chill out, Grandpa! The club meeting was over hours ago. If I didn’t have extra time, I wouldn’t be visiting you."
Wasuke,"Good! Now listen to me since I’ve got free time, too."
Itadori,Not interested.
Wasuke,"Listen anyway. I’ve got some things I want to say before I reach the end. It’s about your parents, and I want you to understand --"
Itadori,"C’mon, I told you. I’m not interested.

Grandpa, please. Can you stop trying to act all cool before you die?"
Wasuke,"Every man has the right to try to go out with a little style. Get a clue, you useless grandson!"
Itadori,"Quit all your complaining.

You don’t have to put on a show for me."
Wasuke,Tsk… You’ve had it too easy.
[Action: Wasuke rolls over and closes his eyes.],
Wasuke,Yuuji?
Itadori,Hm?
Wasuke,"You’re a strong kid, so try to help others. Save the people you can, even if it's only those closest to you. It’s okay if you lose your way, and don’t worry about whether they’ll thank you or not. Just save as many as you can, even if you could only save one.

When you die, you should be surrounded by people. Don’t end up like me."
"[Action: After a few moments, Wasuke lies still.]",
Itadori,Grandpa?
,
[Scene: In the nurses’ office. The phone to Wasuke’s room rings. A nurse picks up the phone.],
Nurse 1,"Yes, what can I do for you?

Are you there? Mr. Itadori!"
"[Action: In Wasuke’s room, Itadori holds back his tears.]",
Itadori,Mm… Mmm…
Nurse 1,Hello? Are you there?
Itadori,My grandpa… is dead.
[Action: Wasuke is wheeled out from the room. Itadori packs his belongings and fills out a form.],
Nurse 2,"There, that’s all the paperwork we need from you."
Itadori,Yeah. Thanks for helping me.
Nurse 2,Are you sure you’re going to be okay?
Itadori,"Well, I, uhh… I’ve never done this before, so it doesn’t feel real yet. But then, I know Grandpa would snap at me if he saw me moping around like this. So I’ll just have to laugh as I roast him."
Nurse 2,Be respectful.
Itadori,Ah…
[Action: Itadori notices Fushiguro standing in the hall.],
Fushiguro,Yuuji Itadori?
Itadori,Hm?
Nurse 2,Hm?
Fushiguro,"I’m Fushiguro from Jujutsu High. I’d like to have a word with you, now."
[Action: Itadori and Fushiguro move to a more private area.],
Itadori,"Um, I’m in mourning right now."
Fushiguro,I understand but this can’t wait. The cursed object you possess is very dangerous. I need you to hand it over.
Itadori,Cursed object?
[Action: Fushiguro holds up his cell phone with a picture of the cursed object.],
Fushiguro,This.
Itadori,"Oh, yeah, that. Yeah, I found that.

I didn’t think much of it, but my friends were totally into it. What’s dangerous about it?"
Fushiguro,"Every year, there are more than 10,000 unexplained deaths and missing persons in Japan.

And most of those are the result of curses."
Itadori,From curses?
Fushiguro,"I don’t care whether you believe in them or not. The fact is they exist. Just listen.

Large pools of negative energy form easily in schools, hospitals, and so on.

Hardship, regret, shame… These emotions of mankind become the source of curses. That’s why most schools secretly keep a cursed object to serve as a protective talisman, just like the one you and your friends found."
Itadori,"If it protects us, shouldn’t we be grateful for it?"
Fushiguro,Just let me finish.
Itadori,Hmm…
Fushiguro,"A cursed object needs to be incredibly evil to keep lesser evil curses away. But its protection isn’t permanent.

The problem is that their seals weaken over time, and then they serve as a lure to attract and strengthen other curses.

The object you found is a dangerous one, classified as special-grade. Now hand it over before people start dying."
Itadori,"Ugh, I already told you that I don’t have it anymore. But here’s the box."
[Action: Itadori tosses the box of the cursed object to Fushiguro. He opens the box.],
Fushiguro,"(Thoughts) It’s empty… I’ve just been following a trace left by the object.

Hold it. Ngh… Where is it?!"
"[Action: As Itadori walks off, Fushiguro grabs his arm.]",
Itadori,"Knock it off. You see, my friends were planning to… uhh…"
Fushiguro,To do what?!
Itadori,"Well, they were saying, “Let's open it up to see what's inside it tonight.”"
Fushiguro,Wha…
Itadori,Uhh… Why? Is that bad?
[Action: Fushiguro backs away from Itadori.],
Fushiguro,"Ngh… It’s way worse than bad.

Your friends… are going to die."
,
"[Scene: At night, at school. Sasaki and Iguchi sit in the clubroom and fiddle around with the cursed object.]",
Sasaki,I can’t get it open.
Iguchi,Did we really need to sneak into the building for this? I’m gonna go turn on the lights.
Sasaki,"No, don't! We need some atmosphere. Enjoying the thrill is part of Occult Club, isn’t it?

It’s not like anything’s going to happen here, anyway."
[Action: Sasaki manages to pick off part of the seal.],
Sasaki,Ah… Hey!
[Action: Sasaki continues unraveling the seal.],
Sasaki,Mmm…
Iguchi,Hmm…
[Action: Sasaki completely removes the seal.],
Sasaki,Uh… Woah…
Iguchi,"Woah, a human finger…"
Sasaki,Is it real?
[Action: The candle is extinguished.],
"Sasaki, Iguchi",Ah!
Sasaki,You think…
[Action: A large explosion occurs.],
"Sasaki, Iguchi",Ah!
[Action: Sasaki drops the finger onto the seal. She gathers both the finger and seal in her hands.],
Sasaki,What's going on?
Iguchi,Ah…!
[Action: A curse appears above Sasaki and Iguchi from the ceiling.],
Curse,Urahhh!
,
"[Scene: At night, on the street. Itadori and Fushiguro are running toward the school.]",
Itadori,Are talismans that easy to open up?
Fushiguro,No. It’s impossible for those without cursed energy… normally.
Itadori,Oh… Go right here! Shortcut!
Fushiguro,This time the object itself is too strong. And the seal is ancient. It might as well be plain paper.
Itadori,I still don’t… get all this stuff about curses.
Fushiguro,Is that the building? Where are they?
Itadori,4th floor!
[Action: Itadori and Fushiguro are hit by a wave of pressure.],
Itadori,"Ah!

Woah, what is this pressure?"
Fushiguro,I’ll handle this.
[Action: Fushiguro climbs the gate to the school.],
Itadori,"Oh, no way! I’m coming.

I may not know those two that well, but… but they’re friends! I have to help!"
Fushiguro,You’re staying here.
,
"[Scene: At night, in the school. A curse roams the hallway as Sasaki hides behind a corner.]",
Sasaki,Ahh… Ah…!
Curse,What time is it?
Sasaki,(Thoughts) Just what is that thing?
Iguchi,Sa… saki…
Sasaki,Ah!
[Action: Iguchi approaches Sasaki.],
Sasaki,"Ah, Iguchi. Thank goodness! Where have you been?"
Iguchi,Help me… Ughh…
Sasaki,Ah… Ahh…!
[Action: A curse clamps around Iguchi’s head and pulls at his mouth.],
Iguchi,Ah…
Curse,What time is it?
[Action: The curse attacks Sasaki.],
Sasaki,Ahh!
[Action: Fushiguro runs upstairs toward Sasaki and Iguchi.],
Fushiguro,(Thoughts) The curse has been unleashed! Ngh… Its presence is everywhere!
[Action: Fushiguro bursts through the doors to find the curse.],
Fushiguro,Ngh!
Curse,Grr…
Fushiguro,"Out of my way!

Demon Dogs!"
[Action: Fushiguro summons two shikigami wolves.],
Curse,Grr…
Fushiguro,"Eat it, boy!"
,
"[Scene: At night, outside the school. Itadori stands alone.]",
Itadori,"(Thoughts) Am I really just going to sit here and wait because he told me to?

(Thoughts) What the hell am I so afraid of?"
Fushiguro,(Flashback) Your friends are going to die.
Itadori,"(Thoughts) He was right. I can sense death all the way out here.

(Thoughts) I’m afraid of dying. Was I afraid of it before? It didn’t feel like I was.

(Thoughts) I didn’t cry because I was scared. I just felt a little sad.

(Thoughts) But my grandpa’s death and the death I’m facing now… How are they any different?"
Wasuke,"(Flashback) You’re a strong kid, so try to help others."
Itadori,Ngh…
,
"[Scene: At night, in the school. Fushiguro continues to fight the curses.]",
Fushiguro,The curses are growing in number… They’re close!
"[Action: Fushiguro finds the main curse, who is consuming Iguchi and Sasaki.]",
Fushiguro,There you are.
"[Scene: At night, at the front gate. Itadori holds onto the bars.]",
Itadori,"(Thoughts) Grandpa was crabby, short-tempered, and stubborn. No one but me ever even visited him.

(Thoughts) “Don’t end up like me”, huh? Well, no chance of that!"
"[Scene: At night, in the school. Fushiguro fights the curse.]",
Fushiguro,Damn! Is it trying to swallow her and the cursed object?!
Sasaki,Ugh…
Fushiguro,I’m not gonna make it!
Curse,Grr?
"[Action: As the curse smiles at Fushiguro, it turns to the window. Itadori bursts through the window on the 4th floor.]",
Itadori,Ngh! Ugh…
Fushiguro,Itadori!
Itadori,"(Thoughts) I think you had a proper death, Grandpa."
[Action: Itadori punches the top of the curse and grabs Sasaki and Iguchi.],
Itadori,"Ngh… Ugh!

(Thoughts) But this kind of a death… is just wrong!"
[Action: Itadori places Sasaki and Iguchi on the ground.],
Curse,Grrr…
Iguchi,Ugh…
Sasaki,Ugh…
Itadori,So this is a curse. Not what I was expecting.
[Action: The curse explodes from Fushiguro’s attack.],
Curse,Urahh! Grahh…
[Action: Fushiguro’s demon dogs start eating the curse.],
Fushiguro,I should be asking what you’re doing here. But good job.
Itadori,"You’re pretty smug, aren't ya?

So, just curious, what are those things munching on the curse?"
Fushiguro,"My shikigami. Wait, you can see them?

Normally, a curse can’t be seen. Not unless you’re on the verge of death or in special places like this."
Itadori,"Yeah, that makes sense. I’ve never seen ghosts or weird stuff like this before."
Fushiguro,"Huh… But, you’re not scared, though?"
Itadori,"I was. I mean, for a little while there. But then, I thought everybody’s gonna die."
Fushiguro,Huh?
Itadori,"So, I wanna make sure that the people I know all have a chance at a proper death.

Ugh… Not that I really understand it."
"[Action: As Itadori stands up with Sasaki in his arms, the talisman falls from her skirt. He grabs the talisman.]",
Itadori,Woah… This it?
Fushiguro,"Yeah. The cursed object, Ryoumen Sukuna’s finger. It’s a miracle that thing didn’t swallow it."
Itadori,Why would anything eat this? Is it good?
Fushiguro,"Don’t be dense. You’d eat it to gain stronger cursed energy. Now, hand it over, it's dangerous."
Itadori,"Fine, here."
"[Action: As Itadori goes to give Fushiguro the finger, a curse hand appears from above.]",
Fushiguro,Ah…!
[Action: Fushiguro pushes Itadori away from the hand.],
Itadori,Ah!
Fushiguro,Run!
Itadori,Ugh! Ugh…
"[Action: The large curse from earlier that day appears from the dust, holding Fushiguro.]",
Curse,Urahh…
Itadori,Damn!
Curse,Urahhh…
Fushiguro,Nue!
"[Action: Before Nue can be summoned, the curse throws Fushiguro into the wall.]",
Fushiguro,Ngh… Hngh! Ugh…
"[Action: As Fushiguro falls to the ground, his demon dogs disappear.]",
Itadori,Ah…
Fushiguro,"Ngh… Ugh…

Guhh…"
Curse,Urahhh…
"[Action: The curse continues its attack on Fushiguro, throwing him out of the school. Fushiguro lands on the roof of a nearby building.]",
Fushiguro,Ngh! Ugh… Ugh…
Curse,Grrr…
Fushiguro,Ngh… Ugh…
Curse,Urahhh!
Fushiguro,Urgh…
[Action: The curse rears up to attack Fushiguro.],
Fushiguro,Damn it… Ngh… Why can’t I think straight?
[Action: Itadori jumps on the curse’s head.],
Itadori,Ngh!
Fushiguro,Itadori! Your only chance is to take those two and run for it!
Curse,Urahh!
Itadori,You’re in big trouble yourself!
"[Action: Itadori grabs onto the curse’s arm, but it flings him around.]",
Itadori,Ugh… Ngh… Ngh… Gahh!
[Action: Itadori is flung into the air.],
Fushiguro,Only a curse can beat a curse! You cannot defeat this!
Itadori,"Is that your idea of a pep talk?! At this rate, we’re both gonna die!"
Curse,Urahh!
Itadori,Ugh! Ngh…
[Action: Itadori runs up the length of the curse’s arm.],
Itadori,"If I quit now, I’ll be having this nightmare for weeks! Ugh… Besides…"
Curse,Urahh!
Itadori,Ngh… I know what I have to do.
Wasuke,(Flashback) Try to help others.
Itadori,I’m living with a rotten curse of my own already!
[Action: Itadori dodges one of the curse’s attacks but gets punched soon after.],
Itadori,Gah! Woah!
"[Action: As Itadori is flung into the air, Sukuna’s finger slips from his grasp. On the way down, he is captured by the curse.]",
Itadori,"Ah… Guh…

Ah… Ah!"
[Action: Itadori captures Sukuna’s finger in his mouth.],
Itadori,Ngh!
Fushiguro,You idiot! Throw it down to me or you’ll both get eaten!
Itadori,Ugh… Ngh!
"[Action: Before he falls into the curse’s mouth, Itadori catches himself on the curse’s teeth. The curse grabs Itadori and tries to force him into its mouth.]",
Itadori,"Ngh…!

(Flashback) Why would anything eat this? Is it good?"
Fushiguro,(Flashback) Don’t be dense. You’d eat  it to gain stronger cursed energy.
Itadori,Ugh… Ngh… Guh!
[Action: Itadori tosses Sukuna’s finger into the air.],
Itadori,"There’s a way I can save everyone! I just need to have my own cursed energy, don’t I?!"
Fushiguro,Don’t do it… Don't do it!
[Action: Itadori eats Sukuna’s finger.],
Fushiguro,"(Thoughts) Ryoumen Sukuna’s finger! That’s a special-grade cursed object! It’s a deadly poison! He’ll die for sure!

(Thoughts) But there is a chance… a one-in-a-million chance…"
[Action: Itadori bursts forth from the curse’s grasp with a new energy.],
Itadori,"Guh!

Ugh…"
"[Action: The curse rushes toward Itadori as he jumps back, but he takes care of the curse with one flick of his arm.]",
Fushiguro,Huh…?
Sukuna,Heh… Hehehe… Hahahahaha! Ah! Hahahaha! I knew it! The light feels best in the flesh!
[Action: Sukuna rips off Itadori’s shirt.],
Fushiguro,(Thoughts) This is the worst. A one-in-a-million chance worst-case scenario! The special-grade cursed object has incarnated!
Sukuna,"Cursed flesh is so boring. So now, where are the people? The women?"
[Action: Sukuna walks Itadori’s body onto the ledge of a building.],
Sukuna,"What a wonderful era to be reawakened. Women and children are crawling everywhere like maggots! How marvelous!

It’ll be a massacre! Hahahahaha!"
[Action: Itadori grabs onto his own face.],
Sukuna,"Oh? Huh?

Uhh… Uhh…"
[Action: Itadori walks his body back onto the building rooftop.],
Itadori,What do you think you’re doing with my body? Give it back.
Sukuna,"Hey, wait. How’re you doing that?"
Itadori,"Well, it's my body!"
Sukuna,"Wait, he’s suppressing me?"
Fushiguro,Stay right where you are! You’re no longer human!
Itadori,Huh?
Fushiguro,"Under Jujutsu regulation, Yuuji Itadori… by law I will now exorcize you… as a curse!"
Fushiguro,"Under jujutsu regulation, Yuuji Itadori… by law I will now exorcize you… as a curse!"
Itadori,"No, really, I’m feeling fine! Besides, you and I are both pretty beat up."
[Action: The markings on Itadori’s body disappear.],
Itadori,Shouldn’t we see a doctor?
Fushiguro,"(Thoughts) I can’t tell if this is Itadori speaking or the cursed object!

(Thoughts) Damn it… What do I do now?"
Gojou,What’s the situation?
Fushiguro,Huh? Satoru Gojou? What’re you doing here?
Gojou,"Hey.

I wasn’t planning on showing up, but you got kinda roughed up, kid. I’ll show the second-years. Say cheese!"
[Action: Gojou takes a bunch of pictures of Fushiguro.],
Gojou,"Haha… Wahaha, hohoho…

I got an earful from the higher-ups ‘cause the special-grade cursed object’s still missing. Thought I’d do a little sightseeing and stop by.

So, did you find it yet?"
Fushiguro,Hmm…
Itadori,Uhh…
[Action: Itadori raises his hand],
Gojou,Hm?
Itadori,"Sorry, but… I ate that thing."
Gojou,Really?
Itadori,I did.
Fushiguro,He did.
Gojou,Hm?
[Action: Gojou inspects Itadori.],
Itadori,Huh?
Gojou,"Hmmm?

Haha! Damn, it really did combine with you. That’s hilarious.

Anything weird about your body?"
Itadori,Nah. Seems okay.
Gojou,Can you swap with Sukuna at will?
Itadori,Sukuna?
Gojou,"Yeah, the curse you ate?"
Itadori,"Oh… Mm-hm. Yeah, I think I can do that."
[Action: Gojou starts stretching],
Gojou,"Okay, give us ten seconds. And change right back into yourself."
Itadori,"Yeah, but…"
Gojou,"Eh, don’t worry. I’m way too strong for him.

Megumi! Hold onto this for me."
Fushiguro,Ah…
[Action: Gojou tosses a shopping bag to Fushiguro.],
Fushiguro,So what is this?
Gojou,"Kikufuku from Kikusuian. It’s Sendai’s specialty, and it’s super good. I recommend the zunda and cream flavor!"
Fushiguro,(Thoughts) This guy actually went and bought souvenirs while people were out here dying?!
Gojou,It’s no souvenir. I’ll be eating this on the bullet train ride home.
[Action: Sukuna takes over Itadori’s body and jumps into the air],
Fushiguro,Look out!
Gojou,Kikufuku’s just the best.
[Action: Sukuna crashes into the ground.],
Fushiguro,Ngh… Ah… Ah…!
[Action: The smoke clears. Gojou sits on Sukuna’s back.],
Sukuna,Grr… Ah…
Gojou,I think it's the whipped cream inside that really makes the difference.
Sukuna,Grrr… Ahhhhhh!
"[Action: Sukuna moves to attack Gojou, but Gojou tosses him to the side and dodges his attacks.]",
Sukuna,Grahh! Grr… Dah! Ngh… Ngh!
[Action: Sukuna releases a flurry of attacks. Gojou dodges Sukuna’s attacks. Sukuna jumps away from Gojou.],
Gojou,"Since my student’s watching, I think I’ll show off a little, yeah?"
Sukuna,"Ngh! Ngh… Grr! Urahh!

(Thoughts) Is he unbelievably fast? No, that’s not it."
[Action: Gojou pushes Sukuna away.],
Sukuna,"Grahhh!

Ngh… For crying out loud… You Jujutsu sorcerers are always such a pain in the ass in any era!"
"[Action: Sukuna attacks Gojou, blasting through the rooftop.]",
Sukuna,Time doesn’t really have much meaning for me. Huh?
Gojou,Seven… Eight… Nine…
Fushiguro,Ugh…
Gojou,And that should do it.
[Action: Sukuna’s heart beats loudly.],
Sukuna,(Thoughts) Dammit! Again? Why can’t I seem to take over this body? Who the hell is this… Itadori… punk…
[Action: Itadori returns to his body.],
Itadori,Oh… How did it go?
Gojou,How about that? So you really can control that guy.
Itadori,"He’s kind of annoying, though, to tell the truth. And I keep hearing his voice."
Gojou,It’s a miracle that’s all he’s doing to you.
[Action: Gojou taps Itadori’s forehead.],
Itadori,Guh… Ugh…
[Action: Itadori loses consciousness.],
Fushiguro,What’d you do to him?
Gojou,I just knocked him out.
Fushiguro,Huh…
Gojou,"If he isn’t possessed by Sukuna when he wakes up, then he might have potential as a vessel.

Now I have a question for you. What do you think we should do with him?"
Fushiguro,Hmm… Well even if he is a vessel… Jujutsu regulations demand Itadori be executed.  However… I don’t want him to die.
Gojou,Personal?
Fushiguro,I suppose. So can you save him?
Gojou,Hehe…
[Action: Gojo lifts Yuji onto his shoulder.],
Gojou,A request from a precious student? Leave it to me!
,
"[Scene: In the present, in the room filled with seals. Gojou speaks with Itadori.]",
Gojou,"But the end result is still, your… execution."
Itadori,"Gah…

Your recap doesn’t match with the current events!"
Gojou,"Hey, sorry, I did my best.

You still have to die, but I got your sentence suspended."
Itadori,What's suspended mean? You’ll wait until later to kill me?
Gojou,Yep. I’ll just explain from the top.
[Action: Gojou takes out one of Sukuna’s fingers.],
Gojou,This is the same kind of thing as the cursed object you ate. There are twenty of these in total. We possess six of them.
Itadori,"Twenty? Oh, each finger and toe?"
Gojou,"No, Sukuna has four arms."
[Action: Gojou tosses the finger into the air and blasts it away into the wall.],
Itadori,Ngh…
Gojou,"As you can see, we can’t destroy them. The curse is that powerful."
[Action: Gojou retrieves the finger.],
Gojou,And the curse grows stronger every day. So our modern-day jujutsu seals just aren’t  keeping up. That’s where you come in.
Itadori,Huh?
Gojou,"When you die, the curse inside you will die, as well.

You see, our elders are cowards. They’re demanding we kill you right away.

But that would be a waste, wouldn’t you say?"
Itadori,A waste?
Gojou,"See, there’s no assurance another vessel capable of handling Sukuna will ever be born again. So, here's what I proposed to them.

Since they’ve already decided to execute you, why not wait until after you’ve absorbed all of Sukuna to do it? And the higher-ups agreed, so now you have two options before you.

You can die here and now or gather all the parts of Sukuna, absorb them, and then die."

[Scene: At Sugisawa Hospital. Sasaki sits at Iguchi’s bedside. Itadori knocks on the door.],
Sasaki,"Ah…

Itadori. Hi…"
Itadori,"Hello, Sasaki. How’s Iguchi doing?"
Sasaki,"Well, the doctors say there’s nothing seriously wrong with him, but he still hasn’t regained consciousness. And this whole thing’s my fault. I… I asked him to come to the school, and… and that night…"
[Action: Sasaki begins to cry.],
Sasaki,"I know you won’t believe it, but we got attacked… by some weird, scary monster. I didn’t… It captured both of us…"
Itadori,"I do believe you. ‘Cause I know that wasn’t a monster, exactly. It was a curse."
Sasaki,Huh?
Itadori,"That finger was a special-grade cursed object. It has the power to draw other curses to it and make them stronger. So none of what happened here was your fault.

It was mine for giving it to you in the first place."
[Action: Itadori grips the frame of Iguchi’s bed.],
Sasaki,Ah…
Itadori,"So, I’m sorry. But it’ll be alright. Someone who can fix Iguchi will be here tomorrow. "
Sasaki,Itadori?
Itadori,"Sorry, Sasaki, but I have somewhere I have to be."
Sasaki,Ah…
"[Action: Itadori turns to leave out the door, and Sasaki stands up from her chair.]",
Itadori,Buh-bye.
[Action: Itadori leaves the room.],
,
[Scene: At a crematorium. Itadori and Gojou sit outside.],
Gojou,Who passed away?
Itadori,My grandpa. Although he was more like a father to me.
Gojou,"I see. Sorry, it had to happen at a time like this.

So, have you decided what you want to do?"
Itadori,Are casualties like these from curses pretty common?
Gojou,"This one was a rather exceptional case, but in terms of damage, it happens all the time. It’s a good night when someone dies a normal death after encountering a curse.

Finding a body that’s torn to pieces is actually one of the better outcomes."
Itadori,Hmm…
Gojou,"If you plan to hunt down Sukuna, you’re going to witness some gruesome stuff… and I can’t guarantee you won’t end up that way yourself. So, I guess you can choose which hell you want."
[Action: Itadori goes into the crematorium to tend to Wasuke’s ashes.],
Wasuke,"(Flashback) You’re a strong kid, so try to help others."
Itadori,"Mmm…

If all the parts of Sukuna were gone… would it really help?

Would there be fewer people getting harmed by curses?"
Gojou,"Yes, of course."
[Action: Itadori finishes gathering Wasuke’s bones.],
Itadori,"Hmm…

So have you got… that finger?"
[Action: Gojou gives Itadori Sukuna’s finger.],
Itadori,"Looking at it again here in broad daylight, it’s pretty disgusting."
[Action: Gojou backs away from Itadori.],
Itadori,Ahh~… Mmm! Mm!
[Action: Itadori swallows Sukuna’s finger.],
Gojou,"(Thoughts) Okay, that’s the second one. One tenth of the whole. I wonder what’s going to happen."
[Action: Sukuna’s marks appear on Itadori’s body.],
Itadori,Ngh!
Sukuna,Heh… Hehehehe…
Itadori,Ngh… Ugh… Ugh… Guh…
[Action: Itadori struggles to walk. He leans against the wall.],
Itadori,Hahahahaha…
[Action: Sukuna’s markings disappear from Itadori’s body.],
Itadori,"Blegh! So gross! I mean, so gross it’s funny!"
Gojou,"(Thoughts) Hehe…There. It’s not just a physical tolerance that he has. He can fight off Sukuna’s attempts to take over.

(Thoughts) We haven’t seen someone with talent like this in a thousand years."
Itadori,What’s wrong?
Gojou,"Oh, nothing at all. I take it this means you’ve made up your mind? Chosen your fate?"
Itadori,"Not at all. I still don’t understand why I have to be executed. But I know… I can’t just do nothing.

Grandpa, that last request of yours is gonna be a pain in the ass.

I’ll eat every part of Sukuna. After that, I don’t care.

As far as how I’m going to die, I’ve already decided."
Gojou,"My guy! I love finding guys like you!

A fun time in hell awaits. Make sure you’re packed by the end of the day."
Itadori,Am I going somewhere?
[Action: Gojou opens the door. Fushiguro stands outside.],
Fushiguro,Tokyo.
Itadori,"Fushiguro! Looking good, brother!"
Fushiguro,"You think this is looking good? Anyway, here’s the deal. You’re going to the school for jujutsu sorcerers that I attend."
Itadori,Huh?
Gojou,"Tokyo Jujutsu High School.

By the way, you’ll be one of only three first-years there."
Itadori,Only three?
"[Scene: Sometime later, in the cemetery. Itadori kneels by Wasuke’s grave.]",
Itadori,"Okay, I’m heading out. Goodbye, Grandpa."
,
[Scene: On a forested path. Itadori and Gojou head to Tokyo Jujutsu High School.],
Itadori,This is really deep in the mountains. Are we still even in Tokyo?
Gojou,This is what the outskirts of Tokyo looks like.
Itadori,Where’s Fushiguro?
Gojou,"He’s being treated by a sorcerer, and at the moment, he’s fast asleep."
[Action: Itadori and Gojou arrive at the school.],
Gojou,"Tokyo Jujutsu High School. It’s one of only two jujutsu educational facilities.

As a sort of cover, it’s known as a private religious school. Many jujutsu sorcerers continue to use it as a base after graduation, so it’s a pillar of the jujutsu community, not just in education, but for support and mediation in missions.

Anyway, you’re about to have an interview with the principal."
Itadori,The principal?
Gojou,"Screw this up and he could turn you down for admission, just like that."
Itadori,Huh?! And what happens then? Immediate execution?!
[Action: Sukuna’s mouth appears on Itadori’s face.],
Sukuna,"What’s this? So you’re not the boss?

Any hierarchy other than strength is worthless!"
[Action: Itadori slaps his hand over Sukuna’s mouth.],
Itadori,"Ngh!

I’m sorry about that. Sometimes he just does that."
Sukuna,What an amusing body you have now.
[Action: Sukuna’s mouth appears on Itadori’s hand.],
Sukuna,"I do owe you a big favor, you know. "
Itadori,Ugh! Not again!
Sukuna,"Once I make this punk’s body my own, you’ll be the first one I kill."
Gojou,It’s my honor to be targeted by Sukuna himself.
[Action: Itadori slaps his hand over Sukuna’s mouth again.],
Itadori,This guy is really that famous?
Gojou,"Ryoumen Sukuna is an imaginary fierce god with four arms and two faces.

But he once existed as an actual human being, although it was over a thousand years ago.

In the golden age of jujutsu, sorcerers gathered all their might to challenge him, and failed. Crowned with the title of Sukuna, we couldn’t even destroy his grave wax as he traversed the ages after death as a cursed object. Without a doubt, he is the king of curses."
Itadori,"Who’s stronger, him or you?"
Gojou,"Well if Sukuna regained all of his power, he might cause me a little trouble."
Itadori,But would you lose?
Gojou,I would win.
[Action: Itadori and Gojou head into Yaga’s office. Yaga makes a bunch of puppets.],
Yaga,"You’re late, Satoru."
Itadori,Ugh… Ngh…
Yaga,Eight minutes late.
Itadori,Ngh…
Yaga,"As usual, not quite enough to chastise you for. I told you fix that habit."
Itadori,(Thoughts) That old dude’s making cute things?!
Gojou,"If it’s not enough to chastise me for, then don’t chastise. Besides, you’re just sitting around making dolls anyway, so what's eight minutes?

Principal Masamichi Yaga."
Yaga,This is the boy?
[Action: Itadori bows.],
Itadori,Yuuji Itadori! I’m into girls like Jennifer Lawrence! This is an honor.
Yaga,What are you here for?
Itadori,"Ah…

An interview?"
Yaga,But why Jujutsu High?
Itadori,To learn jujutsu?
Yaga,I mean beyond that. What do you hope to find once you’ve studied curses… and learn the art of exorcizing them?
Itadori,"Well, I suppose… I’m going to collect all the fingers of Sukuna. Can’t just leave ‘em all out there."
Yaga,Why not?
Itadori,Hm?
Yaga,"People you’ll never know die every day due to crime, accidents, and diseases. It’s just the natural course of life."
Gojou,Here he goes again…
Yaga,But you’re telling me you can’t overlook it when that death is caused by a curse?
Itadori,It was someone’s dying request of me. And I don’t care about the details. I just want to save who I can.
Yaga,"Hmph… Dying wish?

You’re saying you’ll fight curses just because someone else told you to do that?

Insufficient!"
Itadori,Ah…
[Action: Yaga brings a puppet to life.],
Puppet,Grrr…
Itadori,That’s not a doll… It’s alive!
Yaga,"In a way.

They’re corpses, dolls that I’ve infused with my curse. "
Itadori,Ah…!
[Action: A cursed puppet flies at Itadori.],
Puppet,Grr…
Itadori,Guh… Ngh…!
Puppet,Grr…
[Action: Itadori uses his backpack to block the puppet’s punch.],
Itadori,Ah! Ugh!
[Action: The puppet punches Itadori back into a pillar.],
Itadori,"Gah! Ngh…

That’s one hell of a doll…"
Puppet,Hahaha!
Yaga,"A person’s true nature reveals itself during a crisis.

I’ll keep attacking you until I get an acceptable answer."
Itadori,"Ugh… Look, man, it wasn’t just someone else! It was my grandfather’s dying request!

Ugh!"
[Action: Itadori runs forward and punches the puppet in the face. It bounces off the walls.],
Itadori,"Ah… Ngh…

What the… Where is it?"
[Action: The puppet bounces off the wall and hits Itadori.],
Itadori,"Huh?

Gah!

Ngh! Ah… Ugh… Ugh… Ugh! Ngh… Ughh…"
Yaga,Family's still just “someone else”.
Itadori,Ngh…
"[Action: The doll does a dance, taunting Itadori.]",
Itadori,"Grrr…

(Thoughts) Oh, right, it’s a doll, so it doesn’t get hurt or scared."
Yaga,"A jujutsu sorcerer constantly faces death, and not just their own death. Sometimes you must ignore the victims, and rend the flesh from those the curse has murdered.

It’s an unpleasant job. You have to be highly motivated and perhaps a little crazy to handle it.

You’d do this because someone else told you to? Don’t make me laugh!

It’d be more believable if you said you were doing it to postpone your execution."
Itadori,"Oh, screw you! I --"
Yaga,"And tell me this! Are you going to blame your poor grandfather when you get killed by a curse, too?"
Itadori,"Ngh…

Damn, old man. You say some pretty harsh things."
Yaga,Teaching is making people realize truths.
Itadori,That’s right… I guess…
[Action: The puppet punches Itadori in the face.],
Itadori,"Ugh!

Guhhh…"
Yaga,"It’s not easy to imagine how you’ll feel on the verge of death.

However, I can say one thing for certain. At the rate you’re going, you might end up cursing your beloved grandfather for his dying wish. Jujutsu sorcerers never die without regret, so I’ll ask you just once more. Why have you come here… to Jujutsu High?!"
Itadori,"(Thoughts) As a kid, I was always better than most in sports and in fights. But never once did I think, “This is something only I can do.”

(Thoughts) Never!"
[Action: The puppet prepares to punch Itadori. Itadori dodges and locks the puppet in a headlock.],
Itadori,"Ngh… Gahh!

Consuming Sukuna is something only I can do!

So even if I could escape my death sentence and run away from this responsibility… then someday I’d be eating food, taking a bath, or reading manga… and the moment I stopped to think, I’d go… “Oh, I bet that right now somewhere out there someone is dying because of Sukuna. But that doesn’t concern me. It’s certainly not my fault.” You expect me to tell myself that?

Well, I refuse to do that!

I don’t know how I’ll feel when I’m dying, but… I won’t regret the way I lived!"
Yaga,"Satoru, show him to his dorm room. Be sure to explain the security arrangements to him as well."
Itadori,Hm?
Yaga,You’re admitted. Welcome to Jujutsu High.
Itadori,"Hmm!

Guh…"
"[Action: Itadori lets go of the puppet slightly, and it punches him in the face again.]",
Itadori,"Gahh!

Guh… Guhh…"
Yaga,"Uhh, sorry. I forgot to release the curse."
,
"[Scene: Sometime later, at the dorms. Itadori looks at his dorm room.]",
Itadori,Woah! This place is huge!
Gojou,All the second- and third-years are out at the moment.
Itadori,Hello!
Gojou,"But you’ll meet them all soon enough. There aren’t many of them. 

You know, there’s no real reason for you to go fight at all.

Fushiguro and I could retrieve Sukuna’s fingers while you just stay here and chill out."
Itadori,"Yeah, nice try, guy.

I said I’d do it, and I will."
[Action: Itadori imagines himself laying in bed reading manga and a beaten up Fushiguro walks into his room.],
Itadori,"(Imagination) Hey, dude!"
Fushiguro,(Imagination) Ugh…
Itadori,"So, I gotta say, hanging out until Fushiguro comes back all beat up just to bring me a finger? That’d be funny."
Gojou,Yeah! But you wouldn’t have refused to fight. I already knew that.
Itadori,Huh?! That was a test?
[Action: Gojou holds his finger to Itadori’s face.],
Itadori,Mm?
Gojou,"If the fingers were that easy to find, don’t you think we’d have collected them all already?

Some have a presence that’s overwhelming, some keep very quiet, and some have already been absorbed by a cursed spirit. These are the challenges we’ve dealt with… when it comes to searching for them. But, at last we have you.

The Sukuna within you will try to regain his power, and that will lead us to the fingers. You’re both vessel and locator, our very own radar. So you see, we won’t get very far without you. "
Itadori,Are you sure he’s going to be that cooperative?
[Action: Itadori and Gojou come out of Itadori’s dorm room.],
Gojou,"Oh, I think we can come to a win-win agreement there."
[Action: Fushiguro comes out of his dorm room.],
Fushiguro,You’re next door?
Itadori,"Huh?

Hey! Fushiguro! Wow, you look all better now!"
Fushiguro,"There’s lots of other empty rooms, you know?"
Gojou,"Sure, but isn’t it better to have some company? I thought it’d be good for --"
Fushiguro,Classes and the missions are enough. This is not welcome.
[Action: Itadori looks inside Fushiguro’s room.],
Itadori,"Woah, it’s so organized in here."
Fushiguro,Back off. I just told you you’re not welcome!
[Action: Fushiguro slams his door on Itadori.],
Itadori,Erk!
Gojou,"Hah! Friends already. And together, we’re heading out tomorrow!

We’re gonna go pick up the third and final first-year."
,
[Scene: At Morioka Station. A train stops.],
Announcer,The train bound for Tokyo is now arriving. Please stand behind the yellow line.
[Action: Kugisaki stretches on the train.],
Kugisaki,"Mmm…

Four hours and I’m still only in Morioka. But at least I can finally kiss that damn countryside goodbye!

And I’ll be in Tokyo by this afternoon. What should I do if I get scouted?

Like, by Stardust?"
Yaga,"Satoru, show him to his dorm room. Be sure to explain the security arrangements to him as well."
Itadori,Hm?
Yaga,You’re admitted. Welcome to Jujutsu High.
Itadori,Hmm!
,
[Scene: In the Jujutsu Tech dorm rooms. Itadori and Gojou find Fushiguro.],
Itadori,"Hey! Fushiguro! Wow, you look all better now!"
Fushiguro,"There’s lots of other empty rooms, you know?"
Gojou,"Sure, but isn’t it better to have some company? I thought it’d be good for --"
Fushiguro,Classes and the missions are enough.
Gojou,Hmm…
[Action: Itadori looks inside Fushiguro’s room.],
Fushiguro,This is not welcome.
Itadori,"Woah, it’s so organized in here."
Fushiguro,Back off. I just told you you’re not welcome!
[Action: Fushiguro slams his door on Itadori.],
Itadori,Ngh!
Gojou,"Hah! Friends already. And together we’re heading out tomorrow. 

We’re gonna go pick up the third and final first-year."
,
[Scene: At Harajuku Station. Kugisaki arrives in Tokyo.],
Announcer,"The train bound for Shibuya and Shinagawa is now arriving on Track 1.

For your safety, please stand behind the yellow line."
Kugisaki,"(Thoughts) Saori… I’m finally here.

(Thoughts) I’m in Tokyo!"
[Action: Itadori and Fushiguro wait near the train station.],
Itadori,How are there only three first-years? That’s practically nothing.
Fushiguro,Think about it. Can you honestly say you’ve ever met someone else who sees curses?
Itadori,Huh… Guess not.
Fushiguro,Because jujutsu sorcerers… they’re rare.
Itadori,Didn’t you say I was the third first-year?
Fushiguro,"The other’s admission was decided a while ago.

You know what our school’s like. Everyone has unique circumstances."
[Action: Gojou waves to Itadori and Fushiguro.],
Gojou,Sorry for the wait… Ohh! Your uniform made it in time.
Itadori,"Yeah, it fits great! Though I noticed it’s slightly different from Fushiguro’s. Mine has got a hood."
Gojou,That’s because the uniforms can be customized upon request.
Itadori,"Huh?

But I never put in any requests."
Gojou,You’re right. I was the one who put in the custom order.
Itadori,"Huh… Oh, well, cool."
Fushiguro,"Be careful. Gojou has a habit of doing that kinda stuff.

So why are we meeting up here in Harajuku?"
Gojou,Because that’s what she asked for.
Itadori,"Hey, popcorn! I want some!"
[Action: A man follows a woman on Takeshita Street.],
Man,"Why, hello there. Are you on the clock right now?"
Woman,"No, not right now."
Man,"That’s great! You see, I’m looking for potential models.

That’s what I do. Would you be interested?"
Woman,I’m in a hurry right now.
Man,"Wait, just hear me out!"
[Action: The woman walks away.],
Man,Huh…
"[Action: As the man prepares to leave, Kugisaki grabs his collar.]",
Kugisaki,"Hey, you."
Man,Huh?!
Kugisaki,What about me?
Man,"(Thoughts) Oh, boy. Her?!"
Kugisaki,"For that modeling gig. Hey, I’m asking what you think about me."
Man,"Oh, well, uhh, I’m in a hurry at the moment…"
"[Action: The man walks past Kugisaki, but Kugisaki pulls him back by his collar.]",
Man,Ugahh!
Kugisaki,What the hell?! Don’t run. Come out and say what you think!
Man,Eek!
Itadori,"Wait, she’s the one we have to go and talk to?"
Man,I’m sorry! Please let me go!
Itadori,This is real embarrassing.
Fushiguro,"Tsk… Yeah, so are you."
Gojou,Hey! We’re over here! Hehehe…
[Action: Gojou waves at Kugisaki.],
Girl,"Oh, damn! What’s up with that blindfold?"
,
[Scene: Sometime later. Kugisaki throws her suitcase in a luggage locker.],
Gojou,"Right, I’d like you to meet… "
Kugisaki,"Nobara Kugisaki. You should be honored, boys. I’m your group’s girl."
,
,
,
[Scene: At the luggage lockers. Kugisaki stares at Itadori and Fushiguro.],
Kugisaki,Stare~…
Itadori,"I’m Yuuji Itadori, from Sendai."
Fushiguro,Fushiguro.
Kugisaki,"Ngh…

(Thoughts) He looks like a potato. He’s definitely the type that ate his own boogers as a kid.

(Thoughts) And just his name? I can’t stand high-and-mighty dudes.

(Thoughts) I bet he likes setting oil-slicked seagulls on fire.

Ugh… This is what I get to work with? Great, just my luck."
Itadori,She took one look and sighed. That can’t be good.
Fushiguro,Are we going somewhere from here?
Gojou,"Hehehe… Well, we do have all three of you together. And since two of you kids are from the countryside, that means… we’re going to Tokyo."
"Itadori, Kugisaki","Tokyo! Tokyo! Tokyo!

We love Tokyo!"
Fushiguro,Huh?
Itadori,Hahahaha!
Kugisaki,TDL! I want to go to TDL!
Itadori,Idiot! TDL’s in Chiba! Let’s go hit up Chinatown instead!
Kugisaki,"Chinatown’s in Yokohama, dummy!"
Itadori,"Well, Yokohama’s part of Tokyo! How do you not know that?! Look at a map!"
Gojou,"If you quiet down, I’ll announce our destination."
[Action: Itadori and Kugisaki kneel before Gojou.],
Gojou,Roppongi!
"Itadori, Kugisaki",Rop-pon-gi?
,
[Scene: Gojou and the first-years arrive in Roppongi in front of a cursed building.],
Fushiguro,There’s a curse here.
"Itadori, Kugisaki",You liar!
Itadori,This isn’t Roppongi!
Kugisaki,It’s a cruel move to toy with country folk!
Gojou,"There’s a big cemetery nearby. That plus an abandoned building, and you’ve got a curse."
Kugisaki,"Who does he think is responsible for the rice he gets to eat, huh?!"
Itadori,So they pop up more often around graves.
Fushiguro,It’s not the cemetery itself. It’s the fact that people associate cemeteries with fear and uneasiness.
Itadori,"Right. It was the same for schools, too, wasn’t it?"
Kugisaki,"Wait, hold up here. He didn’t even know that yet?"
Fushiguro,To be honest…
[Action: Fushiguro explains that Itadori swallowed Sukuna’s finger.],
Kugisaki,"He swallowed a special-grade cursed object?!

Gross! That’s so unsanitary and disgusting, I wanna hurl!

No way! No way! No way! No way!"
Itadori,That’s not nice!
Fushiguro,I agree with her.
Gojou,"I want to know what the three of you are capable of. Just think of this as a kind of field test.

Nobara, Yuuji, you go exorcize the curse inside that building."
Kugisaki,Ugh!
Itadori,Hold on. I thought only curses could exorcize curses. I can’t use jujutsu yet.
Gojou,"If you look at it, you’re basically half a curse already. Cursed energy flows through your body. Although, controlling that energy isn’t something you can learn overnight, so use this."
[Action: Gojou holds out a cursed tool for Itadori.],
Fushiguro,Ah…
Itadori,Woah…
[Action: Itadori takes the cursed tool.],
Gojou,"The Slaughter Demon. A weapon imbued with cursed energy, so it’ll work on curses too."
Itadori,Hmm…
Kugisaki,"Ugh, how lame."
[Action: Itadori and Kugisaki prepare to enter the building.],
Gojou,"Oh, one more thing."
Itadori,Huh?
Gojou,"Don’t let Sukuna out, ok?

If you use him, you’ll get rid of all the curses in that radius, but anyone nearby’ll get dragged in."
Itadori,You got it. I won’t let him out.
Kugisaki,Ngh… Would you hurry it up?!
Itadori,"All right, all right…"
Gojou,Have fun!
[Action: Itadori opens the garage door. Itadori and Kugisaki go inside and search the area.],
Itadori,Hmm…
,
[Scene: Outside the abandoned building. Fushiguro and Gojou wait outside.],
Fushiguro,"I think I’ll go in, too."
Gojou,"Don’t push yourself. You’re still recovering, you know."
Fushiguro,"But someone needs to keep an eye on Itadori, right?"
Gojou,True. But the one we’re testing this time around is Nobara.
,
[Scene: Inside the abandoned building. Nobara walks past Itadori as he searches and goes up a flight of stairs.],
Kugisaki,What a pain in my ass. I come all the way to Tokyo and I still have to deal with dumb curses.
Itadori,Huh? You didn’t you come here to exorcize them?
Kugisaki,"Let’s save some time. You and I should split up. I’ll start from the top and investigate floor by floor. You start from the bottom.

Let’s knock this out and grab some sushi in Ginza."
Itadori,"Hold on a minute. Let’s take this seriously. Curses are dangerous, you know."
Kugisaki,"Grr…

Ngh… Urgh!"
[Action: Kugisaki kicks Itadori.],
Itadori,Ahhh!
Kugisaki,"I don’t wanna hear it from someone who last week was a clueless normie! Now get moving!

Hmph!"
[Action: Kugisaki turns back and walks upstairs.],
Itadori,You’re an out of control roller coaster of emotions today!
Kugisaki,This is why girls don’t like you!
Itadori,"How do you know they don’t like me, huh?!

Are you even popular enough to talk? Bitch…"
[Action: A curse appears behind Itadori.],
Itadori,Huh?
[Action: Itadori cuts off the curse’s limbs and jumps away.],
Itadori,Ngh!
Curse,Do… you… need… a… receipt?
Itadori,(Thoughts) It’s a curse!
Curse,Hubububub!
[Action: The curse charges toward Itadori. Itadori dodges out of the way and stabs it in the chest.],
Itadori,Ngh!
Curse,Ahhh!
[Action: Itadori speeds toward the curse and continues to attack it.],
Itadori,Ngh… Urgh!
Curse,Ugh… Ugh… Ahh…
Itadori,Ngh… Urah!
[Action: Itadori jumps into the air and stabs the curse in the head.],
Curse,Ahh… Bububuh…
Itadori,Mm-hm. Have I got moves or what?
,
[Scene: Outside the abandoned building. Gojou speaks with Fushiguro.],
Gojou,"That Yuuji… Some screws are loose.

He’s fearless. These things take the form of terrifying creatures that try to kill him.

Yet, the guy has no hesitation at all.

And he doesn’t have the familiarity with curses that you have.

We’re talking about a boy who used to live a normal high school life.

By now, you’ve seen plenty of jujutsu sorcerers, some talented. And you’ve seen them give up cause they couldn’t conquer their fear or disgust, right?"
Fushiguro,Hmm…
Gojou,So today is about seeing if she’s crazy enough for this.
,
"[Scene: In the abandoned building, on an upper floor. Kugisaki finds a bunch of mannequins.]",
Kugisaki,"Phew… Hey, what up, curse?

Yeah, you, mannequin in the center. You actually think you’re hidden there?"
"[Action: Kugisaki draws her weapons, a hammer and a handful of nails.]",
Kugisaki,"Fine, then. I’ll do this from here."
,
[Scene: Outside the abandoned building. Fushiguro shares his opinion.],
Fushiguro,"But Kugisaki has experience, right? So it’s a little late for that now."
Gojou,"As we know, curses are born from human minds… so their strength and numbers grow in proportion to the population."
,
[Scene: In the abandoned building. Kugisaki prepares to fight the curse.],
Kugisaki,Ngh…
[Action: Kugisaki channels cursed energy into her nails and hits them with her hammer toward the mannequins.],
Kugisaki,Hah!
[Action: Kugisaki’s nails hit the mannequin directly in the head. The mannequin falters.],
Kugisaki,"Heh…

Hm?"
,
[Scene: Outside the abandoned building. Gojou poses a question.],
Gojou,Do you think Nobara understands… Tokyo curses are on a different level than those in the countryside?
,
,
,
[Scene: Outside the abandoned building in Tokyo. Gojou speaks with Fushiguro.],
Gojou,"Curses are born from human minds… so their strength and numbers grow in proportion to the population.

Tokyo curses are on a different level than those in the countryside."
,
[Scene: In the abandoned building. The curse appears from the mannequin.],
Kugisaki,"You know, you might want to pull those out."
"[Action: Kugisaki snaps her fingers, and the nails go deeper into the mannequin.]",
Kugisaki,Or my cursed energy will flow into you.
"[Action: Kugisaki’s nails go into the mannequin’s head, and the head bursts. The mannequin falls to the ground.]",
Kugisaki,(Thoughts) Nailed it. Fufufufu…
[Action: Something in the room moves around.],
Kugisaki,Ah…
[Action: Something in the room moves around again.],
Kugisaki,Ah…
Boy,Ngh… Ugh… Ngh…
Kugisaki,"(Thoughts) A kid?

(Thoughts) Huh… Must have snuck in here to play but ran into the curse instead."
[Action: Kugisaki approaches the boy.],
Kugisaki,Hey. It’s all right now. Come on out.
[Action: The boy shakes his head.],
Boy,Mm-mm…
Kugisaki,"Ughhh!

Ahem… Guess he’s intimidated by my beauty. It happens a lot.

I’ll call Itadori."
Boy,Wait!
Kugisaki,Ah…
Boy,Don’t leave me here!
[Action: A curse’s hand appears through the wall and grabs the boy’s head.],
Boy,Ah!
Curse,Blurghurgh…
Boy,Ahh!
Curse,Blurghurgh…
Boy,Ahh! Ngh…
Curse,Hehehehe…
Kugisaki,Hah… Huh?
Boy,Ughh!
Curse,"Blurghurgh…

Hehehehe…"
[Action: The curse holds the boy in front of it and points a claw toward his throat.],
Kugisaki,(Thoughts) Ah… It took him hostage?
[Action: The curse’s claw pierces the boy’s throat slightly.],
Boy,Ngh!
Curse,Hehehehe…
Kugisaki,(Thoughts) This curse… has intelligence?!
,
[Scene: Outside the abandoned building. Gojou continues his explanation.],
Gojou,"When I saw “level”, I don’t just mean the amount of cursed energy they have."
Fushiguro,Hmm?
Gojou,It’s their cunning. Monsters that have gained wisdom will often force cruel choices upon you… where the weight of human lives hang in the balance.
,
[Scene: In the abandoned building. Kugisaki is stuck with what to do about the curse.],
Kugisaki,"Damn it, damn it, damn it! Damn it!!"
Curse,Blurghurgh…
Kugisaki,(Thoughts) This curse isn’t even all that strong!
Curse,Blurghurgh…
Kugisaki,"(Thoughts) Grade 4… Maybe even lower, like a low grade 3!

(Thoughts) But it’s aware of that! That’s why it chose to take a hostage!

(Thoughts) Calm yourself down.

(Thoughts) If I die, the boy dies, too. But if he dies, I won’t die…

(Thoughts) Logically speaking, it’s better if at least I survive. I mean, right?"
[Action: Kugisaki drops her weapons and holds her arms up.],
Kugisaki,I’m unarmed now. Let the boy go.
Curse,Hehehehe!
Kugisaki,"Ngh…

(Thoughts) I’m such an idiot! It’s not letting go of him at all!"
Curse,Blurghrugh…
Kugisaki,Poor Saori. I wish I could have seen her one last time.
Curse,Heh…
[Action: Itadori’s fist comes through the wall.],
Curse,Ah!
Kugisaki,Ah!
Curse,Blurghurgh…
Itadori,Huh? I missed?
Curse,Blurghurgh…
"[Action: Itadori bursts through the wall. The curse holds the boy in front of him and threatens to pierce his neck. Itadori cuts the curse’s hands and fingers off, and the boy is released.]",
Boy,Ngh… Ugh!
[Action: Itadori grabs the boy and kicks the curse away.],
Boy,Ah… Ah!
Itadori,Ngh!
Curse,Arghh!
Itadori,"Ngh… You okay, bud?"
Boy,Mm-hm!
Curse,Urghurghurgh…
[Action: The curse melts back into the wall.],
Itadori,It’s getting away!
Kugisaki,"No, he’s not!

Itadori! Give me that arm!"
Itadori,Huh?
[Action: The curse jumps out of the wall and into the air above Fushiguro and Gojo.,
Curse,Urghurghurgh!
Gojou,Hm?
Fushiguro,I’ll handle it.
Gojou,Hold on.
Fushiguro,Huh?
[Action: Kugisaki throws a straw doll onto the curse’s arm.],
Boy,A straw doll?
Itadori,Creepy.
[Action: Kugisaki’s cursed energy flows into her nails.],
Kugisaki,Straw Doll Technique…
[Action: Kugisaki pounds her nails into the straw doll.],
Kugisaki,Resonance!
[Action: The curse’s heart thumps violently. Several sharp spikes appear from its body as it falls to the ground.],
Curse,Ngh… Ahhh… Ahh!
[Action: The curse is exorcized.],
Fushiguro,Hmm…
Gojou,"Oh, good. All right, she’s crazy."
[Action: The straw doll lets out a sizzling sound. Kugisaki catches her breath.],
Kugisaki,We beat it.
"[Scene: In the past, in Kugisaki’s hometown. A sign shows, “This bridge is dangerous due to deterioration from age and can no longer be used.” A moving truck backs up to a house. Saori moves in from Tokyo.]",
Kugisaki,(Thoughts) When I was in first grade… Saori moved to our village from Tokyo.
[Action: A young Kugisaki sees Saori for the first time.],
Y.Kugisaki,(Flashback) Ah…
Kugisaki,"(Thoughts) She was as cute as a doll… and as kind as a nun…

(Thoughts) Yet Saori… was ostracized by the villagers.

(Thoughts) “She thinks us country folk are dumb,” they said. They got swept up in their own paranoia… and in the end… they drove her out.

(Thoughts) Calling it sickening wouldn’t cover it.

(Thoughts) She brought all of these homemade sweets I’d never heard of. “The ones from the bakery are even better.” She’d smile as she treated me to them.

(Thoughts) If I had stayed in that village… then I…"
"[Scene: In the abandoned building. Kugisaki’s straw doll is sizzling, Itadori chastises Kugisaki.]",
Itadori,"This is why I told you! I said it’s dangerous to go alone, and you need to take it seriously!"
Kugisaki,Except you never said it was dangerous to go alone!
Itadori,"I… Wait, I didn’t?"
Kugisaki,"And, dude, what have you been eating that lets you punch through a wall with your bare hand?!"
Itadori,It wasn’t reinforced concrete!
Kugisaki,So? Most people couldn’t punch through that!
Boy,Uh… Hahaha…
Itadori,"You really don’t think so?

You know, you’ve asked me a ton of questions, but I’ve got one for you. Like, why’d you come here to Jujutsu High?"
Kugisaki,"Why am I here?

Because the countryside sucked, and I always wanted to live in Tokyo!"
Itadori,"Gahhh!

Uh…"
Kugisaki,"This was the only way a poor girl like me could move to the city, without worrying about money."
Itadori,You’d risk your life to save a few bucks?
Kugisaki,I would.
Itadori,Uh… Huh?
Kugisaki,"Since it means being true to myself.

(Thoughts) If I had stayed in that village, I’d be as good as dead.

(Thoughts) Saori… I made it to Tokyo.

(Thoughts) If we ever meet here… take me to that bakery you mentioned."
Kugisaki,"So as far as that goes, I’m grateful to you, too. If you hadn’t been here, and here I had been killed, the future wouldn’t be so bright.

So thanks."
Itadori,Well… I guess we’ve all got our own reasons for being here.
Kugisaki,Drop it! I’ve given you my thanks already! We’re even now! Hehehehe…
Itadori,What is wrong with her?
,
[Scene: Sometime later. Fushiguro and Gojou take the boy back home. Itadori and Kugisaki wait on some stairs.],
Boy,"I live over there!

Thanks again!"
Kugisaki,Did you know I get into a bad mood when I’m hangry?
Itadori,(Thoughts) When are you not in a bad mood?
[Action: Fushiguro and Gojou find Itadori and Kugisaki.],
Gojou,"Hey, there!"
Itadori,Huh?
Gojou,We made sure the kid got home.
[Action: Itadori and Kugisaki stand back up.],
"Itadori, Kugisaki",Ngh…
Gojou,Now how about we grab some food?
Itadori,A juicy steak!
Kugisaki,Sushi!
Gojou,"Just leave it all to me! Megumi, you in?"
[Action: Fushiguro plays on his phone without answering.],
Gojou,Huh?
"[Action: Gojou guides Itadori and Kugisaki along, leaving Fushiguro behind.]",
Gojou,"Okay, let’s go."
Fushiguro,Oh…!
Kugisaki,"Ohhh, I forgot about my biggest haul of the day. Hey, you, go fetch my things."
Itadori,Huh? Why should I do that? I thought we were even now.
Kugisaki,We won thanks to my cursed energy. Got a problem with that?
Itadori,What about my raw strength?
Kugisaki,That freak strength you get from eating weird shit?
Itadori,"It’s not just from that! Right, Fushiguro?"
[Action: Fushiguro says nothing.],
Itadori,"Huh? Fushiguro, what’s the matter?"
Fushiguro,Nothing.
Gojou,He’s pouting ‘cause he didn’t get to fight.
Kugisaki,Pfft… Poor wittle baby!
Fushiguro,Grrr…
Itadori,Pft… Haha! Hahahaha!
,
"[Scene: Sometime later, in July, 2018. Ijichi makes his report.]",
Ijichi,"(Narration) Log: July, 2018. West Tokyo City, Eishuu Juvenile Detention Center.

(Narration) In the sky above the exercise yard."
[Scene: At Eishuu Juvenile Detention Center. Okazaki sees something.],
Boy,Hey… What is that?
Okazaki,What’s what?
Ijichi,(Narration) Unnamed Apparition of Potential Special Grade. Its cursed womb was witnessed by several non-jujutsu sorcerers.
Boy,That up there! Looks like an egg.
Okazaki,What are you talking about?
Ijichi,"(Narration) Due to its emergency nature, three Jujutsu High first-years were dispatched to the scene, and one of them… died."
"[Scene: Rain is pouring outside the Eishu Detention Center. Ijichi gives Itadori, Fushiguro, and Kugisaki information.]",
Ijichi,"Definitely a curse womb. Our window verified that, about three hours ago.

Once 90% were evacuated, the decision was made to seal off the center.

All citizens within a 500-meter radius have been evacuated, as well."
Itadori,"I, uh, have a question."
[Scene: Itadori raises his hand.],
Itadori,What is this “window”?
Ijichi,"It’s an in-house term for unique members of Jujutsu High who can see curses, but they aren’t sorcerers."
Itadori,"Oh, okay."
Ijichi,"Let’s continue.

Detainee Block 2. At present, five detainees are still inside, along with the curse womb.

If the curse womb is the type that metamorphoses, we predict it will become a special-grade cursed spirit."
"Fushiguro, Kugisaki",(Thoughts) Special-grade!
Itadori,"Hey, so… I still don’t really understand what this “special-grade” means."
Fushiguro,Ngh…
Kugisaki,Ugh…
"[Scene: Ijichi stands in front of a projected PowerPoint, holding a pointer]",
Ijichi,"All right, allow me to explain at idiot-level.

First, there’s grade 4. A wooden bat is enough for them.

Grade 3. If you have a handgun, you can rest easy.

Grade 2. Close call with a shotgun. Grade 1. Even a tank may be insufficient. Then special-grade. Well, you might be on even footing if you carpet bomb it with cluster bombs."
Itadori,That is bad!
Fushiguro,"Normally, a sorcerer on par with the cursed spirit would handle this. And in this case, that would have been Gojou."
Itadori,"That figures.

So, where is Gojou then?"
Fushiguro,Away on business.
Itadori,Hm?
Fushiguro,A guy like him has better things to do than loaf around the school in the first place.
Gojou,(Flashback) Don’t expect any souvenirs.
Ijichi,"Unfortunately, we’re often short-handed in this business.

You’ll often have to undertake missions beyond your expertise.

However, this current case is an urgent one and most abnormal, so no matter what, don't fight. And if you encounter a special-grade, you run or you die."
"Itadori, Kugisaki",Ngh…
Ijichi,Please do not disregard your fears. And don't forget that your entire mission here today is strictly the verification and rescue of survivors.
[Action: Okazaki’s mother stands outside the gate.],
Mother,"Excuse me, sir! Tell me, where’s my son?"
Man,"Stay back, ma’am. You can’t come in here. Move back please."
Mother,Where’s Tadashi? I need to know if my son Tadashi is all right!
Itadori,Mmm…
Man,"Please calm down, ma’am. You must stay back."
Mother,"Please, let me through!"
Man,It’s too dangerous. 
[Action: Ijichi blocks Itadori’s view of Okazaki’s mother.],
Ijichi,"She’s a guardian here for a visit.

Please leave, madam. It's possible that someone may have released poisonous gas in the compound."
Mother,Ahh…
Ijichi,I’m afraid we can’t share any more details at this time.
Mother,"Oh, no… Ngh…"
[Action: Okazaki’s mother falls to her knees.],
Mother,Why is this happening? Mmm…
Itadori,"Hmm… Fushiguro, Kugisaki… We’ll save them."
Kugisaki,Of course.
Fushiguro,Hmph.
,
,
,
"[Scene: At the Eishu Detention Center. Itadori, Fushiguro, and Kugisaki head to the entrance to Block 2.]",
Ijichi,"Be careful.

I’ll put up my Veil.

Emerge from darkness, blacker still. Purify that which is impure."
[Action: Ijichi’s Veil spreads over the detention center.],
Itadori,"Huh?

Day’s turning into night!"
Fushiguro,"That's part of the Veil.

Since there’s a residential area nearby, we use it to conceal us from those on the outside."
Itadori,Awesome!
Kugisaki,Moron.
Fushiguro,Demon Dogs.
[Action: Fushiguro summons his white Demon Dog.],
Demon Dog,Awooo!
Itadori,Woahhh…
Fushiguro,He’ll let us know if the curse gets close.
Itadori,"Aw, good boy, buddy! What a good boy!"
[Action: Itadori pets Fushiguro’s Demon Dog.],
Itadori,You know we’re all counting on you.
[Action: Fushiguro opens the door to Block 2. His Demon Dog runs ahead.],
Fushiguro,Let’s go.
"[Action: Itadori, Fushiguro, and Kugisaki head into the detention center.]",
Fushiguro,Ngh… Hold on!
Itadori,Woah!
Kugisaki,Ngh… What the hell is this?!
Itadori,Wh-What’s going on here? I thought this was only a two-story dorm building… isn’t it?
Kugisaki,"Well, maybe it's a condo… Chill out."
Fushiguro,"(Thoughts) No, it’s not. It’s the deployment of an Innate Domain due to cursed energy. I’ve never seen one this big before.

Ah… The door!"
Itadori,Huh?
Kugisaki,Huh?
Itadori,"Hey, it’s gone!

Impossible!"
Kugisaki,No way! We just came through that door a second ago!
Itadori,Uh-huh!
[Scene: Itadori and Kugisaki walk around in a circle with a striped tarp in the background and lanterns above them.],
"Itadori, Kugisaki",♪ What do we do? What do we do? It’s a major problem!
Fushiguro,It’ll be fine. The dog remembers the scent of the entrance.
"Itadori, Kugisaki","Oh, good!"
[Action: Itadori pets Fushiguro’s Demon Dog.],
Itadori,Good boy!
Kugisaki,Good dog!
Itadori,Good boy!
Kugisaki,"Good dog, boy!"
Itadori,"Who’s a good boy? Huh? Huh?

That's right! You are a good dog!"
Kugisaki,Now you get all the beef jerky you want!
Itadori,Hahahaha!
Fushiguro,Stop playing around!
Itadori,"You rock, Fushiguro! You’re such a pro!"
Fushiguro,Ngh…
Itadori,"Thanks to you, we can rescue some people and save ourselves!"
Fushiguro,Let’s keep moving.
[Action: The trio continues on. They find the bodies of three inmates.],
Itadori,"Ah…

Huh…"
Kugisaki,Horrible…
Fushiguro,"Looks like… three victims, right?"
[Action: Itadori inspects one boy’s shirt. His name tag says Tadashi Okazaki.],
Itadori,Ah…
Mother,(Flashback) Where’s Tadashi?! I need to know if my son Tadashi is all right!
Itadori,Let’s take this body back with us.
Kugisaki,Huh?
Itadori,This is that woman’s son.
Kugisaki,But…
Itadori,His face isn’t too mangled. How will she accept his death if we can’t show her a body to prove it?
[Action: Fushiguro pulls Itadori away from the body.],
Itadori,Woah!
Fushiguro,We still have to find and verify two more. Leave that body behind.
Itadori,That makes no sense! The way we got inside isn’t even there anymore! We won’t be able to come back for it later!
Fushiguro,I didn’t say we’d come back! I said leave it behind!
Itadori,Huh?
Fushiguro,"I’m not about to risk my own life for someone I had no intention of saving in the first place, so forget it!"
[Action: Itadori grabs Fushiguro’s collar.],
Itadori,You had no intention of saving him? Are you kidding?
Fushiguro,"It’s a juvie detention center, and as a jujutsu sorcerer, I had access to information about this guy.

Tadashi here hit and killed a little girl on her way home from school while driving without a license.

And that was his second offense!"
Itadori,Ngh…
Fushiguro,"I know you’re keen on this idea of saving lots of people and guiding them to proper deaths.

But think! How are you going to feel when someone you save goes on to kill someone else later?"
Itadori,"Ngh… So?! Why’d you bother saving me, then?!"
Kugisaki,"You both need to cut it out! Ugh!

What the hell is wrong with the two of you?! Are you guys both idiots?! This is hardly the time or place to be acting like… Ugh!"
[Action: Kugisaki disappears into the floor.],
Itadori,Kugi… saki?
Fushiguro,(Thoughts) No way! Demon Dog should have sensed the curse!
[Action: Fushiguro sees the head of his Demon Dog in the wall.],
Fushiguro,Ah… Itadori!
Itadori,Huh?
Fushiguro,Time to run! We’ll find her later! Right now we… cu… Ah!
Itadori,Ah…
[Action: A Finger Bearer appears next to Itadori and Fushiguro.],
Fushiguro,(Thoughts) No mistaking it. It’s a special-grade. I can’t move…
Itadori,"(Thoughts) Move. Move… Move, move, move!"
Wasuke,"(Flashback) You’re a strong kid, so try to help others."
[Action: Itadori reaches for the knife at his side.],
Itadori,Urahhh!
[Action: Itadori’s hand is sliced off and the sword lands in the concrete behind him and shatters. His hand is wrapped around the hilt.],
Fushiguro,Ita… dori?
[Scene: Itadori is looking at his severed arm in shock. It’s gushing blood.],
Itadori,Huh…?
,
[Scene: Elsewhere in the detention center. Kugisaki wanders by herself.],
Kugisaki,"Where am I? It’s so dark. I can’t see a damn thing in here.

Ah!"
[Action: Kugisaki pulls her nails out],
Kugisaki,(Thoughts) The curse’s presence.
[Action: Several curses float in the air.],
Curses,Hehehe…
Kugisaki,(Thoughts) Ugh… How can there be so many?!
Curses,Hahahaha…
,
[Scene: Elsewhere in the detention facility. Fushiguro flies through the hallways.],
Fushiguro,Nue!
[Action: Fushiguro summons Nue. Nue holds onto Fushiguro’s shoulders with its claws.],
Nue,Urahh!
Fushiguro,"Ngh! Ngh…

(Thoughts) Itadori and Kugisaki! Don’t you die on me!"
[Scene: Sometime earlier. Itadori prepares to fight the Finger Bearer.],
Itadori,(Flashback) I can’t run away. Not when I’ve gotten this close.
F. Bearer,(Flashback) Hehehe…
[Action: Itadori wraps a strap around his bleeding arm.],
Itadori,"(Flashback) Hey, Sukuna, if I die here then you die, too, right?

(Flashback) So you have to help me out!"
[Action: Sukuna’s mouth appears on Itadori’s face.],
Sukuna,"(Flashback) Not true! Even if the part of me that’s inside you dies, there are 18 other fragments of my soul still out there!

(Flashback) Still, irritatingly enough, I don’t yet have control of this body. So if you want to switch, go ahead and switch. But once you do, I’ll kill this punk sorcerer before the cursed spirit can!

(Flashback) And then I’ll do the woman. She’s a lively one. I’ll have some fun with her!"
Itadori,(Flashback) I’m not gonna let you do that!
Sukuna,"(Flashback) Is that right? But if you get all focused on me, then your friends are gonna die!"
[Action: The Finger Bearer inhales deeply and shoots cursed energy at the ground.],
F. Bearer,(Flashback) Blegh!
Fushiguro,(Past Thoughts) It’s not jujutsu… He just unleashed pure cursed energy…
F. Bearer,(Flashback) Hahaha! Hahahaha!
Itadori,(Flashback) Fushiguro! Fushiguro! Fushiguro!
Fushiguro,(Flashback) Huh?
Itadori,"(Flashback) Find Kugisaki and get her out of here! I’ll stay here and keep this one busy, at least until you two are clear!"
F. Bearer,(Flashback) Hehehe…
Itadori,"(Flashback) As soon as you’re both out, give me some kind of signal. And then… I’ll switch bodies with Sukuna."
Fushiguro,(Flashback) You’ll never stand a chance! Fighting that thing with one hand?!
Itadori,(Flashback) Look closer.
Fushiguro,(Flashback) Ah…
Itadori,(Flashback) That curse is having fun. It's obviously toying with us. At least I can buy us some time.
Fushiguro,(Flashback) You can’t!
Itadori,(Flashback) Fushiguro… It’s okay.
[Scene: In the present. Fushiguro runs through the hallways.],
Fushiguro,"Ngh… Ngh!

Demon Dogs!"
[Action: Fushiguro summons his black Demon Dog.],
Fushiguro,Find Kugisaki!
,
[Scene: Elsewhere in the detention center. Kugisaki holds her last nail.],
Kugisaki,Down to my last one already… Haa…
Curses,Hahaha…
Kugisaki,I guess I should’ve brought a few more along with me.
,
[Scene: Elsewhere in the detention center. The Finger Bearer tears off its cloak.],
F. Bearer,Hehehehe… Grrr! Hehehehe…
Itadori,"Heh… Guess you’re saying it’s easier to move around stripped down to your underwear!

(Thoughts) What am I supposed to do? I have no idea how to use cursed energy. For now, that’s fine. I just have to buy some time --"
[Action: The Finger Bearer blasts Itadori with cursed energy.],
F. Bearer,Urah!
Itadori,"Gahh!

Ngh…

(Thoughts) What the hell was that? A cursed energy barrier?

Ah…"
F. Bearer,Heh!
"[Action: The Finger Bearer hits Itadori with another blast of cursed energy, smashing through the wall.]",
Itadori,"Gah!

Ahh!

Ngh…

Ngh… Ugh… Ughh… Ahh…"
F. Bearer,Hmm?
Itadori,Ah…!
[Action: Itadori stands up and holds his arms out.],
Itadori,Ngh… Ugh!
F. Bearer,Urahh!
[Action: The Finger Bearer blasts Itadori with more cursed energy.],
Itadori,Ngh… Ahh… Grr… Ahh… Urahh!
[Action: Itadori’s fingers melt away.],
Itadori,"(Thoughts) Ow… Ow, ow! It hurts, it hurts, it hurts! Why am I doing this…

(Thoughts) If only I hadn’t picked up that finger back then! If only I hadn’t eaten it…

(Thoughts) If only… If only…

(Thoughts) Stop it! Don’t think!

(Thoughts) No… No! I want to run, I want to run, I want to run! I don’t want to die…

(Thoughts) If I died here… If I actually died… would that be a proper death?!

Nghhh… Don’t think!!"
Wasuke,(Flashback) So try to help others.
Itadori,(Thoughts) Have I… Have I gotten so weak?
,
[Scene: Elsewhere in the detention center. Kugisaki’s hammer is broken. A curse holds her upside down.],
Kugisaki,You! I know your face now!
Curses,Hehehehe…
Kugisaki,I swear I’m going to curse you!
Curse,Fufufufu…
[Action: The curse prepares to eat Kugisaki.],
Curse,Ahh~… Ahh~…
Kugisaki,Ngh…
[Action: Fushiguro’s Toad grabs Kugisaki out of the curse’s grasp.],
Kugisaki,Ahhh!
Curse,Huh?
[Action: Fushiguro’s Great Serpent bites the curse.],
Curse,Urahh!
[Action: Kugisaki is pulled into Fushiguro’s toad’s mouth.],
Fushiguro,We’re out of here now! Let’s go!
Kugisaki,"You know, I really hate frogs."
Fushiguro,"Well, that’s too damn bad!"
,
[Scene: Elsewhere in the detention center. The Finger Bearer approaches a slumped over Itadori.],
F. Bearer,Heh!
Itadori,"I was so proud…

I thought I was really strong. At least strong enough that I could choose when and how I’d die. But, I’m not.

I’m weak… I’m way too weak!

Ngh… Ugh… I don’t want to die!

Nghh! But I am going to die! No way… Not like this. No! Ngh…"
[Action: Itadori cries.],
Itadori,"Not like this…

(Thoughts) A proper death?

(Thoughts) Yeah, right! Don’t be naive!"
Yaga,(Flashback) Jujutsu sorcerers never die without regret.
Itadori,(Thoughts) Still… I want to be able to say my death was a proper one.
Fushiguro,(Flashback) These negative emotions of mankind become the source of curses.
Itadori,"(Thoughts) So, all the hate, the fear… the regret… Let it all out!  And put it in your fist!"
[Action: Itadori’s fist alights with cursed red energy. Itadori charges forward.],
F. Bearer,Hehehe!
Itadori,Urahhh!
F. Bearer,Hehehehe!
[Action: The Finger Bearer catches Itadori’s fist.],
F. Bearer,Hehehehe…
Itadori,Damn… Nothing…
Demon Dog,Awooo!
Itadori,"Ah…

(Thoughts) That howl…"
Demon Dog,Awooo!
Itadori,(Thoughts) That must be the signal from Fushiguro…
[Action: Sukuna appears.],
F. Bearer,Ah!
Sukuna,Incredible. What a pain this brat is.
,
,
,
[Scene: In the detention center. Sukuna faces the Finger Bearer.],
Sukuna,Incredible. What a pain this brat is. It’s obvious he’s just screwing around with me!
[Action: Sukuna puts his hand on the Finger Bearer’s shoulder.],
F. Bearer,Ahh…
Sukuna,"Hold on a moment. I’m thinkin’ here.

What I need is some way to make him regret doing all of this.

(Thoughts) Nahh… If I went after him, that punk would just switch right back!

(Thoughts) So the thing that would cause him the most trouble… is probably this!"
[Action: Sukuna is picturing him and the cursed energy vs. Fushiguro.],
Sukuna,(Thoughts) I’ll just put things back the way they were!
F. Bearer,Ah… Ah…
[Action: Sukuna begins walking away. The Finger Bearer jumps back in fear.],
Sukuna,"All right, let’s go kill some kids."
[Action: Sukuna regenerates Itadori’s finger beckons the spirit.],
Sukuna,Follow me.
F. Bearer,Ngh… Ngh… Grrr… Ngh!
[Action: The Finger Bearer begins to summon cursed energy in his hands.The Finger Bearer begins to throw the energy towards Sukuna.],
Sukuna,(Thoughts) Idiot.
F. Bearer,Urahhh!
[Action: The Finger Bearer sends a blast of cursed energy at Sukuna. Sukuna regenerates Itadori’s hand and deflects it easily.],
Sukuna,"Huh? Well, shit. I healed his other hand, too."
F. Bearer,Ahh!
Sukuna,"What? You don’t like to take walks?

Well, that's true. Cursed spirits are usually supposed to stay where they’re born. Fine, fine. In that case… you will die here."
[Action: Sukuna slams the Finger Bearer’s head into the ground.],
F. Bearer,Gahh! Ahh… Gahh…
Sukuna,"Hey, what’s the matter? You’re not finished already, are you?"
F. Bearer,Ngh… Grrr…
Sukuna,"Yeah, good… That’s the way. Just try a little harder.

Ngh… Hngh!"
"[Action: Sukuna slams his foot onto the Finger Bearer’s head, crumbling the ground beneath them.]",
F. Bearer,Ngh!
[Action: The Finger Bearer grabs Sukuna’s ankle.],
Sukuna,Huh?
F. Bearer,Urahh!
"[Action: The Finger Bearer moves to throw Sukuna, but Sukuna rips its arm off. Sukuna sits cross-legged across from the Finger Bearer.]",
Sukuna,Even a cursed spirit… is bound to miss his arm.
F. Bearer,Eek!
Sukuna,Hehehe… Hahahaha… Hahahaha! Hahahaha!
[Action: The Finger Bearer falls into the water below.],
,
[Scene: Outside the detention center. Ijichi prepares to leave with Kugisaki. Kugisaki is unconscious in the backseat.],
Fushiguro,We need to expand the evacuation area to ten kilometers.
Ijichi,What about you?
Fushiguro,I’ll stay. I’m going to wait for Itadori.
Ijichi,"Understood. All right, let me get Kugisaki to the hospital. Then I’ll come back here for you."
Fushiguro,"No, you wouldn’t be of that much use in this situation."
Ijichi,Mm…
Fushiguro,"To really help, you could have them send us a sorcerer who’s Grade 1 or higher.

If one was around."
Ijichi,I’ll do my best. Later.
[Action: Ijichi rolls the car window up and drives off with Kugisaki. Fushiguro stands in the rain and looks back to the detention center.],
Fushiguro,"(Thoughts) Even if this goes South, if the worst case happens…

(Flashback) I don’t want him to die. Gojou, can you save him?

(Thoughts) … it will be my responsibility to end him."
,
"[Scene: In the detention center. Sukuna speaks with the Finger Bearer, who now has its arms and legs removed and pinned to a wall.]",
Sukuna,"Hey, did you know about this? Surprisingly, you and I both are apparently classified as special-grade. Good job! You and me, man!"
F. Bearer,"Grr… Ngh! Ngh…

Grrr! Ngh… Graph…"
[Action: The Finger Bearer regrows its arms and legs.],
Sukuna,"All right, special-grade! You just keep tryin’."
[Action: The Finger Bearer jumps down from the wall.],
F. Bearer,Hehehe…
Sukuna,"Pleased with yourself, huh? You want praise now?

But healing with cursed energy isn’t all that difficult. It’s a lot easier for cursed spirits than it is for humans.

Neither you nor this punk whose body I’m in truly understand what curses really are. This is a good opportunity.

So I’ll use it to show you… exactly what real jujutsu is."
[Action: Sukuna brings his hands before him in a pyramid shape.],
Sukuna,Domain expansion.
[Scene: In Sukuna’s Domain. Sukuna stands before a shrine.],
Sukuna,Malevolent Shrine.
F. Bearer,Erk… Eek!
[Action: The Finger Bearer is instantly cut into many pieces.],
Sukuna,"I was only planning to slice you into three, but I guess you were weaker than I thought. 

Oh, yeah, and then there’s this."
[Action: Sukuna removes his finger from the Finger Bearer’s chest.],
Sukuna,I will be taking this.
[Action: Sukuna holds up the finger. The Finger Bearer disintegrates into a flash of purple flames.],
Sukuna,"It’s over, you punk!

What are you waiting for?! If you’re gonna switch, then do it already!

Uh-oh. Something wrong, brat?

Hehe…"
[Action: Sukuna smiles with a devilish grin and a gleam in his eye.],
Sukuna,"Well, well…"
[Scene: In the detention center. Sukuna waits for Itadori to possess his own body again.],
Sukuna,"This sucks! If you’re gonna switch, just do it already!

What’s the matter, brat?

Heh…"
,
[Scene: Outside the detention center. Fushiguro waits by the gate and senses something.],
Fushiguro,"Ah…

(Thoughts) The Innate Domain is closed off! The special-grade is dead!

(Thoughts) Now we just need Itadori to return safely…

Ah!"
Sukuna,"Sorry, but he’s not coming back."
Fushiguro,Ah…
Sukuna,"Don’t be so frightened. I’m in a great mood right now. Let’s chat for a bit.

This is what he gets for trying to use me without any kind of pact. Feels like he’s having some trouble switching back.

Still, though, it’s only a matter of time."
[Action: Sukuna rips off Itadori’s clothes.],
Sukuna,So… I thought about what I can do right now.
Fushiguro,Ah…!
Sukuna,Fufu…
[Action: Sukuna digs his hand into Itadori’s chest.],
Fushiguro,Ah!
Sukuna,Fufufufu…
Fushiguro,Wh-What are you…?
[Action: Sukuna rips out Itadori’s heart.],
Sukuna,I’m taking this brat hostage.
Fushiguro,Hostage?
Sukuna,"Yeah. I can live without this, but that ain’t true for the brat."
[Action: Sukuna tosses Itadori’s heart aside.],
Sukuna,Switching out with me means he dies. Also…
[Action: Sukuna takes out his finger.],
Sukuna,… for good measure.
[Action: Sukuna eats his finger.],
Fushiguro,"(Thoughts) Sukuna’s finger!

(Thoughts) That special-grade cursed spirit in there must have consumed it!"
Sukuna,"With that, I’m free as a bird. You can be frightened now. I’ll kill you.

For no particular reason."
Fushiguro,"Our positions are reversed now.

Ngh…"
,
,
,
[Scene: Outside the detention center. Fushiguro prepares to fight Sukuna.],
Fushiguro,"(Thoughts) The only thing granted equally to all is an unfair reality.

You just don’t get it. He’s… Itadori’s coming back.

It’ll happen even if that means he’ll die. That’s just who he is."
Sukuna,"You give him too much credit. This guy’s just a little tougher and denser than other humans.

Just a moment ago, he was scared out of his mind, on the verge of death, and prattling on about his regrets and all that nonsense.

I know for a fact that he doesn’t have the guts to kill himself."
Fushiguro,"(Thoughts) His arm is restored!

(Thoughts) Healing… He can use Reverse Cursed Techniques.

(Thoughts) Sukuna’s incarnated. Even if he can live without a heart, it should still be damaging to him.

(Thoughts) I’ll make him heal his heart before Itadori returns. I just have to make him believe he can’t beat me without a heart in his body!

(Thoughts) Can I do that… when I couldn’t even move with that special-grade in front of me?

Phew…

(Thoughts) It’s not about whether I can. I have to do it!"
[Action: Fushiguro summons Nue.],
Nue,Urahh!
Sukuna,"I’m finally outside, after all. Let’s use the open space."
"[Action: Fushiguro punches and kicks at Sukuna, but Sukuna dodges his attacks easily.]",
Fushiguro,"Ngh!

Ugh! Ngh… Ngh! Ngh!"
Sukuna,"Heh… Interesting. You can use Shikigami, but you still come at me yourself?"
Nue,Urahh!
Fushiguro,"Ngh!

Ngh!

Grr… Ngh… Ugh!"
Sukuna,More.
Fushiguro,Ugh… Ngh…
Sukuna,More.
Fushiguro,Ngh… Ugh…
Sukuna,More!
[Action: Sukuna grabs Fushiguro’s fist and spins him around.],
Fushiguro,Ugh… Ngh…
Sukuna,Heh… Put more curse behind it…
[Action: Sukuna punches Fushiguro in the face.],
Fushiguro,Ngh… Gah!
Sukuna,… when you strike me. Hehehehe…
Fushiguro,(Thoughts) Orochi!
[Action: Fushiguro summons his Great Serpent. It bites Sukuna and pulls him into the sky.],
Sukuna,Hm?
Fushiguro,Gang up on him!
Nue,Urahh!
[Action: Nue attacks Sukuna multiple times.],
Sukuna,Heh…
[Action: Sukuna explodes Fushiguro’s Great Serpent.],
Fushiguro,Ah!
[Action: Sukuna grabs Fushiguro’s shirt.],
Sukuna,"Hey, what did I just say?"
Fushiguro,Guh!
Sukuna,Let’s use this open space!
[Action: Sukuna throws Fushiguro into the trees.],
Fushiguro,"Ugh!

Ngh… Ah!

Ngh!"
[Action: Sukuna kicks Fushiguro into a building.],
Fushiguro,"Ugh!

Gah!"
[Action: Nue catches Fushiguro as he flies out of a building.],
Nue,Urahh!
Fushiguro,(Thoughts) It’s not even a matter of jujutsu. His power and his agility are on a different scale!
Sukuna,Nice techniques there!
[Action: Sukuna hits Fushiguro and Nue into another building.],
Fushiguro,"(Thoughts) What do I do? I used up one of my Shikigami to escape that Innate Domain.

(Thoughts) Demon Dog White and Orochi are both destroyed… And Nue’s at his limit, too.

(Thoughts) I should release him before he gets destroyed."
[Action: Fushiguro releases Nue.],
Sukuna,I get it now. So your Shikigami are created from shadows.
Fushiguro,"(Thoughts) It makes no difference if he knows that now.

So what?"
Sukuna,"Hmm…

(Thoughts) It’s not the generic technique that uses charms. It’s adaptable, too.

I don’t get it, though. Why did you run back then?

Heh… What a waste of talent."
Fushiguro,Huh?
Sukuna,"Whatever.

Either way, that won’t be enough to fix this."
Fushiguro,"(Thoughts) He figured it out, huh?"
Sukuna,You’re risking your life over stupid shit. This brat isn’t even worth that much.
Itadori,(Flashback) Then why did you bother saving me?!
Fushiguro,(Thoughts) The only thing granted equally to all is an unfair reality!
Tsumiki,"(Flashback) If I have the time to curse someone, I’d rather spend it thinking about those precious to me."
Fushiguro,"(Thoughts) There was no room to doubt what a good person she was.

(Thoughts) She deserved happiness more than anyone else. But Tsumiki was still cursed.

(Thoughts) The father who named me “Megumi” with no regard for my gender is still off living as he pleases somewhere.

(Thoughts) Karma isn’t fully automatic.

(Thoughts) Evil people can only be judged under the law.

(Thoughts) Jujutsu sorcerers are just another cog in that machine of retribution.

(Thoughts) I want more good people to enjoy fairness, even if only a few… so I save people unequally!"
[Action: Fushiguro’s cursed energy grows.],
Sukuna,"Nice. That’s it!

So this is when you start burning through your life!

Now I see. Well, in that case… show me, Fushiguro Megumi!"
Fushiguro,"Sacred treasure swing and ring, ring, Eight Grip… Ah…"
[Action: Fushiguro’s cursed energy dissipates. Itadori returns to his body.],
Fushiguro,"Just so you know, I… don’t have any logical reason for saving you back then.

Even if it was dangerous, I couldn’t bear to see a good person like you die. I did have my reservations, but ultimately, it was for selfish, emotional reasons.

That’s fine, though. I’m not a hero.

I’m a jujutsu sorcerer.

I’ve never once regretted saving you."
Itadori,"I see. You really are smart, Fushiguro. You’ve put more thought into this than I have.

I think your conviction’s a proper one, but I don’t think mine is wrong, either."
[Action: Itadori bleeds heavily.],
Itadori,"Oh, sorry. I’m almost done for. Guess I won’t have to worry about you, Kugisaki, or gojou-sensei.

Live a long life."
[Action: Itadori falls forward.],
Fushiguro,Grr… Ngh…

,
"[Scene: A new day, in Tokyo. Kenjaku, Jougo, Hanami, Dagon walk through the streets.]",
Jougo,"Well, tell me. Was there any real reason to use a precious finger to test Sukuna’s strength?"
Kenjaku,"Well, there wasn’t much point to it with a half-baked test case.

But we did learn a few things."
Jougo,Hmph. I’ll be praying that’s not just an excuse.
Dagon,"Bleph, bleph…"
[Action: Hanami makes a garbled noise.],
Jougo,"Stop talking! No one understands what you’re saying!

We don’t understand, yet the meaning flows right into our minds. It’s creepy!"
"[Action: Kenjaku, Jougo, Hanami, and Dagon walk into a restaurant.]",
Woman,"Welcome!

Would you like a seat for one?"
Kenjaku,"Yes, one, please."
,
"[Scene: At Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School, in the morgue. Itadori’s body is covered in a white cloth.]",
Ijichi,"If you encounter it, your choices are to either run or die. I warned them that fighting was absolutely not an option."
Gojou,It was intentional.
Ijichi,Huh? What do you mean?
Gojou,"There was a special-grade. Sending first-years to rescue five who may or may not be alive should be out of the question.

Besides, with Yuuji, I was the one who forced the issue and got his execution indefinitely suspended. Some higher-ups who didn’t like that took advantage of my absence and the special-grade to tactfully dispose of him."
Ijichi,Ah…
Gojou,"If the other two had also died, it’d be more harassment for me and two birds with one stone for them."
Ijichi,No! But… no one expected it to become a special-grade by the time the dispatch was issued.
Gojou,"Searching for someone to blame is just a pain.

Maybe I should just… kill all of the higher-ups."
Ijichi,Ah…
[Action: Ieiri enters the room.],
Ieiri,You’re not usually this emotional.
Ijichi,"It’s good to see you, Ieiri-san!"
Ieiri,Looks to me… like you’ve taken quite a liking to him.
Gojou,I’ve always been a nice guy who cares for my students.
Ieiri,Don’t torment Ijichi too much.
Ijichi,Ah…
Ieiri,"He’s got it rough, stuck between us and the higher-ups."
Ijichi,"(Thoughts) Keep going, keep going, keep going!"
Gojou,I don’t care about a man’s hardships.
Ieiri,That so?
Ijichi,Ah!
Ieiri,So this is…
[Action: Ieiri pulls the sheet of Itadori’s body.],
Ieiri,"… Sukuna’s vessel, huh?

I can take him apart as I please, right?"
Gojou,Make sure to get good use out of him.
Ieiri,"Oh, I will.

Who do you think I am?"
,
[Scene: In the courtyard. Fushiguro and Kugisaki mourn.],
Kugisaki,"“Live a long life”? Doesn’t mean much when you go and die yourself.

Is this your first time having a partner die?"
Fushiguro,First time for one my age.
Kugisaki,"Oh? You seem to be taking it well, considering."
Fushiguro,Same to you.
Kugisaki,"Of course. I only knew him for about two weeks.

I’m not some simple woman who breaks down bawling when a guy I barely know dies.

Tsk… Jeez…"
[Action: Kugisaki struggles to hold back tears.],
Kugisaki,Ngh…
Fushiguro,"It’s hot, huh?"
Kugisaki,Yeah. I wonder if it’s time for summer uniforms.
"[Action: Maki, Inumaki, and Panda approach Fushiguro and Kugisaki.]",
Maki,"What’s this?

You’re looking more glum than usual, Megumi. This a wake or something?"
Fushiguro,Zenin-senpai.
Maki,Don’t call me by my last name!
[Action: Panda calls to Maki from behind a statue. Inumaki stands near him.],
Panda,Maki! Maki!
Maki,I’m talking here.
Panda,Y-You actually don’t know why they’re so down?
Maki,What are you talking about?
Panda,Someone really did die yesterday! One of the first-year boys!
Inumaki,Bonito flakes.
Maki,"Erk! You should’ve told me sooner!

Now I look like some heartless, cold-blooded demon!"
Panda,That’s exactly how you came off.
Inumaki,Tuna and mayo.
Maki,You’re supposed to try to make me feel better!
Kugisaki,Who are those guys?
Fushiguro,Our second-year upperclassmen.
Panda,You have to be kinder to your underclassmen.
Maki,There’s more to kindness than being soft on them.
Fushiguro,Zenin-senpai is the best of all the students at wielding cursed tools.
Inumaki,Salmon roe.
Fushiguro,"That’s the Cursed Speech user, Inumaki-senpai. He can only speak in ingredients of rice balls."
Panda,"He’s a bit softer when Yuuta’s around, though."
Fushiguro,"Panda-senpai.

There’s one more, Okkotsu-senpai, who’s the only one I can openly respect… but he’s overseas right now."
Kugisaki,You’re not adding more about the panda named Panda?
Panda,"Man, sorry about this. And when you’re in mourning… Please forgive us for that.

The truth is we’d like you to participate in the Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event."
Kugisaki,"Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event?

What’s that?"
Fushiguro,"It’s a get-together with the other Tech School in Kyoto.

Though isn’t that event mainly second- and third-years?"
Maki,"And those stupid third-years are suspended right now, so you need to participate."
Kugisaki,What do you do at this event? Smash Bros? I won’t lose if it’s the Wii version. I’ll Meteor Smash so you can’t come back.
Panda,"Then let’s make a three-man team.

The exchange event has the principals of the Tokyo and Kyoto schools each propose a form of competition to be held for an entire day over the course of two days.

Though that’s just how it is on paper. Every year, the first day is team battles, and the second day is individual battles."
Inumaki,Salmon.
Kugisaki,Individual and team battles? We fight?! Against other jujutsu sorcerers?!
Maki,"Yeah, it’s a jujutsu battle where anything but killing goes."
Panda,"We’ll train you up well so you won’t get killed. Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
Kugisaki,"Hm? Wait, do you have time for that? I thought we were short on jujutsu sorcerers."
Panda,"That’s a good question. For now, we are.

The glum emotions people harbor from late winter through spring cause an outburst of curses in the summer, so that’s our busy season."
Maki,"Sometimes we’re busy all year long, but things should be settling down soon."
Kugisaki,Huh…
Maki,"So, you’ll do it, right? You just had a partner die on you, after all."
"Fushiguro, Kugisaki",We’re in!
Kugisaki,(Thoughts) I…
Fushiguro,(Thoughts) I…
"Fushiguro, Kugisaki",(Thoughts) … have to get stronger. I’ll do anything to achieve that!
Kugisaki,"But if I decide this training and exchange event is pointless, I’m quitting instantly."
Fushiguro,Same here.
Maki,Heh!
Panda,"Well, people this cocky are all the more worthwhile to train."
Inumaki,Bonito flakes.
,
"[Scene: At the restaurant in Tokyo. Kenjaku, Jougo, Hanami, and Dagon are at their table.]",
Kenjaku,So you’re saying your boss wants to reserve the current positions of humans and curses. Is that it?
Jougo,"Well, roughly. It’s slightly different, though.

Humans are made up of lies. For every positive action and emotion they show, there’s always a flip-side.

Yet negative emotions like hatred and hostility are truths without falsehood. Since we curses are born from those emotions, that makes us true, pure beings! Imitations should be eliminated!"
Kenjaku,"Yet, at present, you’re the ones being eliminated."
Jougo,That’s why we’ve come to ask you. What can we do to defeat jujutsu sorcerers?
Kenjaku,"If you fulfill two conditions before going to war, then you can win."
Jougo,And what are these two conditions?
Kenjaku,"The first involves the man known as the strongest jujutsu sorcerer. You have to render Gojou Satoru incapable of fighting.

The second is to get Ryoumen Sukuna and Itadori Yuuji on your side."
Jougo,"Err… Hold on. He died, didn’t he? That Itadori Yuuji brat, I mean."
Kenjaku,"Did he, though? I’m not so sure."
,
[Scene: In Sukuna’s domain. Sukuna sits on a throne of bones.],
Sukuna,"Don’t look inside me without permission. I hate it… brat.

Heh…"
[Scene: In Sukuna’s domain. Sukuna sits on a pile of bones as he watches Itadori.],
Sukuna,"Don’t look inside me without permission.

I hate it, brat."
Itadori,"Then come down from there, and I’ll look down on you!"
,
,
,
[Scene: In Sukuna’s domain. Sukuna continues to watch Itadori.],
Sukuna,"You’re being awfully hostile, aren’t you?"
Itadori,Damn straight I am. You just killed me.
Sukuna,This is the thanks I get for fixing your arm?
Itadori,"Yeah, and you ripped out my heart right after that!"
Sukuna,Haa…
Itadori,"Is this Hell?

I’m not sure I can accept being stuck with you even after death. This works out, though. I’ll make you cry!"
"[Action: Itadori throws a skull from Sukuna’s bone pile at Sukuna. Sukuna dodges, but Itadori continues to charge.]",
Itadori,"Urahh! Hope you’re ready for this!

Urahh! Ngh!"
"[Action: Itadori punches at Sukuna, but Sukuna blocks his hits easily.]",
Sukuna,Fufu…
Itadori,Urgh! Ahh! Ngh! Ugh!
[Action: Itadori punches the ground.],
Sukuna,(Thoughts) He was aiming for where I stood?
Itadori,"You fell for it!

I got you!"
"[Action: Itadori goes for a leg sweep, but Sukuna dodges easily.]",
Itadori,Huh?
Sukuna,"Man, you’re boring."
[Action: Sukuna kicks Itadori off the platform.],
Itadori,"Ah!

Gah! I thought I landed that one perfectly!"
[Action: Sukuna jumps on Itadori’s back.],
Itadori,"Ugh!

Damn it!"
Sukuna,This isn’t the afterlife.
[Action: Sukuna sits on Itadori’s back.],
Itadori,Erk!
Sukuna,It’s my Innate Domain.
Itadori,Innate Domain? That thing Fushiguro was talking about?
Sukuna,"You could also say we’re in my mind. In other words, we’re not dead yet."
Itadori,Ah…
Sukuna,"If you’ll accept my conditions, I’ll fix your heart and bring us back to life."
Itadori,"Cocky bastard… You act all big, but I know you don’t want to die, either."
Sukuna,"The situation’s changed. In the near future, I’ll be able to see something interesting.

I have two conditions. One: When I chant “Extension”, you’ll hand over your body for one minute. Two: You’ll forget this promise."
Itadori,"No way! I don’t know what your goal is, but it’s shady as hell. After what you did this time, I finally get it. You’re evil. I’m not lending you my body again!"
Sukuna,Then I’ll promise that I won’t kill or injure anyone during that minute. Haa… So annoying.
Itadori,Like I can believe you!
Sukuna,"It’s not about whether you believe me or not. This is a pact.

It’s a geas. I’ll be the one punished if I break it.

If you pursue selfish gain beyond your means, you’ll earn retribution. I’m pretty sure you’ve experienced that for yourself."
Itadori,It wasn’t a problem before!
Sukuna,"Huh? Oh… That time, I wanted to switch, too. And you were just doing as that sorcerer told you to.

A pact founded in mutual interest. That’s one of the key factors behind all jujutsu."
Itadori,"Fine, then. Move. I’ll accept your conditions."
[Action: Sukuna gets off Itadori. Itadori gets up.],
Itadori,"Haa…

I don’t know what you’re trying to do, but it means I’ll come back to life!"
[Action: Itadori punches Sukuna in the face.],
Sukuna,Ngh…
Itadori,Like hell I’d say that. Bring me back to life without any conditions. It’s your fault I died in the first place.
Sukuna,"Haa… Then how about this? We’ll fight to the death, and if you win, I’ll do it without conditions. If I win, you come back to life under my conditions."
Itadori,Sure! I’ll beat you to --
[Action: Sukuna kills Itadori instantly.],
,
"[Scene: At Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School, at the morgue. Gojou and Ijichi have a chat.]",
Gojou,"You know, I have a bad personality."
Ijichi,I know.
Gojou,"Ijichi, expect a hard forehead flick later."
Ijichi,F-Forehead flick?
Gojou,Being a teacher isn’t my style. Do you know why I decided to teach at this school? Ask me.
Ijichi,Err… Why did you?
Gojou,Because I have a dream.
Ijichi,A dream?
Gojou,"Yep. As you can see in this case with Yuuji, the top of the jujutsu world is a den of vice. Conservative fools, traditional fools, arrogant fools, just plain fools. It’s a bargain sale on rotten mikan.

I want to reset that garbage jujutsu world."
Ijichi,Ah…
Gojou,"Murdering everyone at the top would be an easy task, but they would just get replaced. It wouldn’t bring a revolution. And if I did that, no one would follow me.

That’s why I chose education. To raise up strong, clever comrades.

That’s also why I occasionally tossed my missions to my students. It’s tough love."
Ijichi,(Thoughts) Are you sure you don’t just want to slack off?
Gojou,"They’re all talented, especially the third-year Hakari and the second-year Okkotsu. They’ll become jujutsu sorcerers on par with me.

Yuuji was one of those, as well."
Ijichi,Ahh…
Ieiri,"Hey, you two."
"Gojou, Ijichi",Huh?
Ieiri,I’m about to get started. Are you just gonna watch from there?
[Action: Itadori sits up.],
Ijichi,Ahh!
Gojou,Ah…
Ieiri,Hm? Ah…
Itadori,"Woah, I’m completely naked!"
Ijichi,G-G-G-Gojou-san!
Gojou,Fufufu…
Ijichi,H-H-H-H-He’s alive!
Gojou,"Ijichi, be quiet."
Ieiri,I’m kind of disappointed.
Itadori,"Um, I’m embarrassed to ask, but who are you?"
Gojou,Yuuji.
Itadori,Huh?
Gojou,Welcome back.
Itadori,Yeah. Good to be back!
[Action: Itadori and Gojou high-five.],

Ieiri,"Ugh, I’ll have to revise the reports."
Gojou,"No, leave them as-is."
Ieiri,Hm?
Gojou,"I want to give Yuuji time to gain the minimum power necessary before he’s targeted again.

Sorry, Shouko, but could you leave Yuuji listed as dead on the records?"
Ieiri,Huh? So you plan to keep Itadori completely hidden away?
Gojou,"No, I’ll have him make his comeback in time for the Exchange Event."
Ieiri,Why?
Gojou,"The reason is simple.

No one’s allowed to take the events of youth away from young people."
[Scene: In the morgue. Itadori puts a shirt on.] ,
Itadori,I bet everyone will be surprised.
Ijichi,Err… Ngh…
[Scene: In a courtyard. Gojou and Ieiri continue their talk.],
Gojou,Not anyone.
,
"[Scene: At a restaurant. Kenjaku, Jougo, Hanami, and Dagon sit at a table.]",
Man,"(Thoughts) Starting right now, I’m ditching work!

(Thoughts) I’ve always had a strong sense of responsibility. I’ve been saving up my earnings so I can send my four younger sisters to college, too. But even I can’t fight my survival instinct!

(Thoughts) If I go near that table, I’ll die!"
Jougo,Gojou Satoru… I wonder if we could kill him if we joined forces.
Kenjaku,"Either he’d flutter out of your grasp, or worst case, you’ll all get exorcized. I would recommend you pour energy into sealing him rather than killing him."
Jougo,Seal him? Do you have a lead?
Kenjaku,We’ll use the special-grade cursed object Prison Realm.
Jougo,Ah… Prison Realm?!
Men,"Table 5 hasn’t ordered anything at all. Someone go hurry him up. He’s taking up a whole table by himself.

Sorry, boss, but I quit!

Huh? What?!"
[Action: One of the waiters runs out of the restaurant.],
Man,Hey! Hold on a minute!
Jougo,You have that detestable thing?!
[Action: The volcano on Jougo’s head erupts.],
Man,"Huh? Our AC is running, isn’t it?"
Kenjaku,"Jougo, don’t get too excited. You’ll make it hot in here."
Man,"Sir, have you decided on your order?"
[Action: The waiter bursts into flames.],
Woman,Ahh!
Man,Ahh!
Woman,Ah… No!!
Kenjaku,I wish you wouldn’t cause too much commotion.
Jougo,This is hardly anything.
[Action: Jougo makes other people in the restaurant combust.],
Man,"Ahh!

Ahhh!"
Girl,"What?

Ahh!"
[Action: Kenjaku coughs slightly.],
Kenjaku,I’m glad we didn’t choose an expensive restaurant.
Woman,Ah… Ahh… Ahh! Ngh…
Jougo,"Getou, how strong am I in terms of Sukuna’s fingers?"
Kenjaku,"At a low estimate, I’d say eight or nine fingers?"
Jougo,"That’s plenty. Give me the Prison Realm! I’ll add it to my collection.

In return, I will… kill Gojou Satoru."
Woman,Help me --
[Action: Jougo ignites the last woman in the restaurant.],
,
,
,
[Scene: At Okazaki’s mother’s apartment. Fushiguro talks to Okazaki’s mother.],
Fushiguro,"By the time we arrived on the scene, your son was already dead."
Mother,Ahh…
Fushiguro,"To be honest, I was skeptical about saving any of the people in there. But my friend was different.

He wasn’t successful, but he tried to bring your son’s body back to you after we confirmed his death."
Itadori,(Flashback) Please.
[Action: Fushiguro takes out a bag with Okazaki’s name tag.],
Fushiguro,"Take this, at least."
[Action: Okazaki’s mother takes the bag.],
Fushiguro,I’m sorry we weren’t able to save Tadashi-san.
Mother,"It’s all right… Don’t apologize… I’m the only one who will mourn his passing, anyway…

Wahhh…"
[Action: Okazaki’s mother falls to her knees and cries.],
,
[Scene: At Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School. Kugisaki and Panda run around the field.],
Maki,"You’re late, Megumi."
Inumaki,Kelp.
Maki,What were you doing?
Fushiguro,"What does it matter?

Zenin-senpai…"
Maki,Huh?
Fushiguro,… what kinds of people do you want to save as a jujutsu sorcerer?
Maki,Huh? It’s not like I care if my actions save anyone.
Fushiguro,I shouldn’t have asked.
Maki,What?!
[Action: Panda holds Kugisaki by the legs and spins her around in the air.],
Kugisaki,"Fushiguro! Quit asking interview prep questions!

Switch with me! I’m sick of these school uniforms! Let me go buy some cute tracksuits!"
Panda,Here we go!
Kugisaki,Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
Panda,There!
[Action: Panda throws Kugisaki.],
Kugisaki,Ahh!
Fushiguro,What are those two doing?
Panda,Falling practice.
Inumaki,Mustard leaf.
Panda,"You’re both weak in close quarters, after all."
Maki,So first… land a blow on us. We’ll talk after that.
,
[Scene: In a secluded room. Gojou teaches Itadori about using cursed energy.],
Gojou,"You’re a head above the rest when it comes to close combat, Yuuji. So what you need to learn right now is how to control cursed energy, as well as the bare minimum of jujutsu knowledge."
Itadori,Hehehe…
Gojou,What’s the matter?
Itadori,"Oh, I figured you’d be the best person to train me, so I’m just happy.

I’m weak, and I couldn’t save anybody. Worse, I nearly killed Fushiguro.

As I am now, I won’t be able to face them.

I want to become strong.

Teach me to be the strongest!"
Gojou,Fufu! You’ve got a keen eye.
Itadori,"Sensei, you’re the one who called yourself the strongest."
Gojou,"All right, first, take a look at those drink cans over there."
[Action: Gojou explodes two soda cans without touching them.],
Itadori,Woah!
Gojou,"This is with cursed energy, and this is with a cursed technique."
Itadori,I see. I don’t get it.
Gojou,"Right, well…

Think of cursed energy as electricity and cursed techniques as appliances.

Electricity by itself is hard to use, right?

That’s why we run electricity through appliances to achieve various results.

Here, I just fired off pure cursed energy.

Here, I channeled cursed energy into a cursed technique to activate it and twist the can with jujutsu."
Itadori,"In other words, I’m about to learn a very, very good cursed technique?!"
Gojou,"No, you can’t use cursed techniques."
Itadori,What?
Gojou,"Setting aside simple Shikigami and barriers, cursed techniques are fundamentally etched into your body from the day you’re born."
Itadori,Huh?
Gojou,So the power of a jujutsu sorcerer is roughly 80% innate talent.
Itadori,Ahh… Ahhh…
[Action: Itadori falls to the ground in disappointment.],
Gojou,You okay?
Itadori,I just thought I’d be able to pull off thunder or fire or a power bomb or something…
Gojou,"You can pull off a power bomb. Oonita’s, right?"
Itadori,"Ahh… This sucks… I wanted to pull off a Spirit Gun or Bankai, or Rasengan, or a Dodon Ray…"
Gojou,"(Thoughts) You just can’t use them yet. Eventually Sukuna’s cursed techniques will be engraved into your body.

Let’s just ignore what you can’t do! We’re going to enhance your strengths. We’ll get you to imbue your fighting style with cursed energy. I’m way more scared of someone who can force their way through the basics than I am of inferior jujutsu!"
Itadori,Huh?
Gojou,"Like I just said, your talent for close combat is top-notch!"
Itadori,"Ah!

But wait! I can already do that!"
Gojou,Get up.
Itadori,"Back then, I somehow managed to get the hang of that."
Gojou,Then give it a try.
[Action: Gojou points to his palm.],
Gojou,Hit me here. Not that you actually can.
Itadori,Don’t blame me if you get hurt.
Gojou,Just hurry up and do it.
[Action: Itadori punches Gojou’s palm.],
Gojou,That didn’t have any cursed energy behind it.
Itadori,How?!
Gojou,"Negative emotions are the source of cursed energy. In the incident you’re referring to, you were probably brimming with anger and fear."
Itadori,"Ah! So you have to be constantly flipping out to use cursed energy?

Oh! Now that you mention it, Fushiguro’s always a bit snappy."
Fushiguro,(Imagination) Grr… Demon Dogs!
Demon Dog,"(Imagination) Woof, woof!"
Gojou,Not like that.
,
[Scene: On the track field. Fushiguro feels a sensation.],
Fushiguro,Ngh…
[Action: Panda continues spinning Kugisaki in a circle.],
Kugisaki,Ahh!
Maki,What’s the matter?
Fushiguro,I just got really irritated.
Maki,Huh?
Fushiguro,"No, not at you."
[Action: Panda tosses Kugisaki.],
Panda,Hup!
Inumaki,Salmon roe!
Maki,"There’s only a month and a half until the Exchange Event, so no dawdling. Here, you can try the long one next."
[Action: Maki gives Fushiguro a staff.],
Fushiguro,This actually feels pretty good.
,
[Scene: In the secluded room. Gojou continues to teach Itadori.],
Gojou,"Everyone’s trained to produce cursed energy using the faintest sparks of emotion.

They’ve also trained on how not to waste cursed energy when emotions are flaring, too.

There are several methods to train this. I’ll be having you use a pretty exhausting one."
Itadori,L-Like what?
Gojou,Watching movies.
Itadori,Watching movies?
Gojou,"Yep. Everything from masterpieces to C-grade horror films and terrible French movies! You’ll be watching them nonstop as long as you’re awake. Of course, you won’t just be watching them."
[Action: Gojou brings out one of Yaga’s cursed puppets. It sleeps deeply.],
Gojou,You’ll be watching them with this guy.
Itadori,What’s with the cute but creepy doll?
Gojou,It’s cute?
[Action: Gojou gives Itadori the doll.],
Gojou,It’s a cursed corpse the principal made.
Itadori,"Ah, I knew it! It’s his style."
[Action: Itadori tries to wake the puppet but can’t.],
Itadori,And? I don’t understand what you’re getting at here.
Gojou,"Don’t be hasty, now. You’ll see soon."
[Action: The puppet wakes up.],
Puppet,Grr… Ngh!
[Action: The puppet punches Itadori in the face.],
Itadori,Gahh!
Gojou,"That cursed corpse will wake up and attack you, just like that, if you don’t keep pouring a set amount of cursed energy into it."
Itadori,Oww!
Gojou,"Like I said, we have all kinds of movies available here. Heart-throbbers, thrillers, exciting ones, ones that’ll make you cry, laugh, or feel disgusted!"
Itadori,Urgh…
Gojou,"Your first goal is to watch an entire movie from start to finish without waking the cursed corpse.

This trains you to maintain a steady output of cursed energy, no matter what emotions you feel. You can’t use too much or too little."
[Action: Itadori picks up the puppet again. It wakes up momentarily.],
Puppet,"Grrr!

Grr…"
[Action: The puppet goes back to sleep.],
Itadori,Phew… Ah!
Puppet,Grrr!
Gojou,"I have to set to the faint level of cursed energy you can produce right now, but it’ll steadily start demanding greater output, so don’t let your guard down."
Itadori,I couldn’t let it down even if I wanted to.
Gojou,"What do you want to start with? I recommend this one! The heroine’s annoying, but she dies spectacularly in the end."
Itadori,"Major spoilers.

I say we start off with an action --"
[Action: The puppet punches Itadori in the face.],
Puppet,Grr!
Itadori,Erk!
[Action: Itadori throws the puppet at the ground.],
Itadori,"Oh, come on!"
Gojou,"Hey, even if you’re irritated, keep the cursed energy steady."
,
"[Scene: On the track field. Fushiguro, Maki, Panda, and Inumaki rest.]",
Panda,"Carrying cursed tools, huh?"
Fushiguro,"I agree with supplementing my close combat with weapons, but with my cursed technique, I want to be able to free up both my hands at any time. With swords, you lose time sheathing them.

Zenin-senpai, you often carry more than two around with you, right? How do you do that?"
Maki,I make Panda carry them.
Panda,Heh…
Fushiguro,"(Thoughts) I shouldn’t have asked, part two."
Panda,Some sorcerers keep cursed spirits that can store and retrieve objects.
Maki,"He can’t do that. It’s a rare thing, and it takes time to tame them, as well. But if you find any, let me know."
Panda,A year’s supply of Calpas.
Sukuna,"(Flashback) I don’t get it, though. Why… did you run back then?

(Flashback) Heh, what a waste of talent."
Fushiguro,(Thoughts) I have the potential to beat special-grades? Is that what he meant by that?
[Action: Fushiguro puts his hand to the ground.],
Fushiguro,Mm…
[Action: Fushiguro’s fingers go through the concrete.],
Inumaki,"Tuna, tuna."
Maki,Huh? What?
Fushiguro,Senpai… I think I can do it.
,
[Scene: In the city. Kugisaki goes on a shopping trip but looks around the area frantically.],
Kugisaki,Ngh… Ngh… Ura-Hara! Where’s Ura-Hara?! Underground?!
,
[Scene: In the secluded room. Itadori watches a movie.],
Man,“Do I cut the red wire or the blue wire?”
Woman,"“You know, in the area where I used to live, the designated trash bags…”"
Man,"“Hey, what are you going on about right now?”"
Woman,"“… were red for plastic trash and blue for combustible trash. I always thought, ‘Shouldn’t it be the opposite?’”

“It should be red! Anyone would go with red!”"
Man,“I’ll trust you.”
Woman,“Ngh…”
Puppet,Ngh!
[Action: Yaga’s puppet punches Itadori in the face.],
Itadori,Don’t do that while I’m drinking soda!
Gojou,"Don’t drink it, then."
Itadori,But you gotta have chips and soda when watching movies at home!
Gojou,"That’s true.

Okay, I have some business to deal with. Just keep hanging in there."
Itadori,Will this really make me stronger?
Gojou,"Fufu…

Oh, right.

Did you talk to Sukuna while you were dead?"
Itadori,Talk?
Gojou,"When he fixed your heart, did he propose any conditions or contracts?"
Itadori,"Oh, I think we did talk about something… but I can’t remember what it was."
Gojou,I see.
,
"[Scene: At night, in a car. Ijichi drives Gojou back toward the school.]",
Ijichi,We have a bit of time before your appointment with the principal. Did you want to stop anywhere?
Gojou,"It’s fine. I’ll show up early for a change.

Hmm…

Stop the car."
Ijichi,Huh? Right here?
[Action: Gojou gets out of the car.],
Gojou,Go on ahead.
Ijichi,"Huh?! A-Are you testing me? You’re not going to hit me if I actually go on ahead, are you?"
Gojou,Just what do you think I am?
Ijichi,Ah! In that case…
[Action: Ijichi drives off.],
Gojou,Now…
Jougo,Urahhh!
[Action: Jougo appears from the sky and smashes into the road. Gojou dodges the attack.],
Jougo,Heh…
Gojou,Who are you?
"[Scene: At night, on the road back to Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School. Ijichi drives Gojou.]",
Ijichi,We have a bit of time before your appointment with the principal. Did you want to stop anywhere?
Gojou,"It’s fine. I’ll show up early for a change.

Hmm…

Stop the car."
Ijichi,Huh? Right here?
[Action: Gojou gets out of the car.],
Gojou,Go on ahead.
Ijichi,"Huh?! A-Are you testing me? You’re not going to hit me if I actually go on ahead, are you?"
Gojou,Just what do you think I am?
Ijichi,"Ahh, in that case…"
[Action: Ijichi drives off.],
Gojou,Now…
Jougo,Urahhh!
[Action: Jougo appears from the sky and crashes into the ground. Gojou dodges the attack.],
Jougo,Heh…
Gojou,Who are you?
Jougo,Urahh!
[Action: Jougo summons a volcano near Gojou. It blasts fire at Gojou.],
Jougo,"Fufufufu… That was easier than I expected.

Hm?"
Gojou,Who are you… calling easy?
[Action: Gojou appears from the fire completely unscathed.],
Jougo,Ngh… Brat.
Gojou,"(Thoughts) He’s a cursed spirit, but he can communicate clearly.

(Thoughts) And the sheer amount of cursed energy… An unregistered special-grade?

(Thoughts) He’s likely stronger than Sukuna currently is.

Special-grades are classified as such because they’re special. Having them pop up this frequently throws everything off."
Jougo,Hehehe… Did I wound your pride?
Gojou,Nope… I’m starting to find this fun. Heh…
,
,
,
[Scene: On the road. Gojou prepares to battle Jougo.],
Jougo,"Finding this fun, you say?

No sense of danger at all."
Gojou,"(Thoughts) He chose a place devoid of people?

(Thoughts) No, he was avoiding other sorcerers coming to back me up."
Jougo,Ember Insects!
[Action: Jougo’s Ember Insects fly toward Gojou.],
Gojou,"Well, if you’re coming after me, you’re right about having no sense of danger."
[Action: Gojou stops the Ember Insects in their tracks.],
Gojou,What happens if this hits me?
Insects,Grrr…
Gojou,(Thoughts) Sound?
Insects,Grrr…
"[Action: The Ember Insects explode around Gojou, but he dodges the attack.]",
Gojou,A two-stage attack of sound and explosions? That’s clever.
Jougo,Urahh! Gah!
[Action: Jougo lights Gojou on fire.],
Jougo,Ngh… There’s more!
[Action: Jougo blasts Gojou forward with cursed energy.],
Jougo,"That’s all it took? I took a look for myself, and it was just an overestimation by the weak. That human was as fragile as the rest.

He wasn’t living a life of truth. It’s all so nauseatingly repulsive!

I’m going to go spread real strength, the truth, through death."
Gojou,We just…
Jougo,Huh?
Gojou,"… went over this a moment ago.

Can’t you even learn? Ugh, this smoke…"
Jougo,What’s the meaning of this?
Gojou,"Oh… To put it simply, you didn’t hit me."
Jougo,Impossible. That wasn’t like before. I know I touched you and killed you.
Gojou,You touched the “Infinity” that exists between you and me.
Jougo,Hm?
Gojou,"I’ll show you.

Put your hand out."
Jougo,Err…
Gojou,"Come on, come on."
Jougo,Mm…
Gojou,"Come on, come on, come on."
Jougo,(Thoughts) No hostility? I guess I’ll see what it’s about.
[Action: Jougo puts his hand toward Gojou’s but can’t touch his hand.],
Jougo,Huh?
Gojou,See?
Jougo,"(Thoughts) I can’t touch him? It stops just before him.

(Thoughts) This is Infinity?"
Gojou,"You’re not exactly stopped, but the closer you get, the slower you go."
Jougo,Grr…
Gojou,"So, what now?

We could just shake hands like this, you know."
[Action: Gojou touches Jougo’s hand.],
Jougo,Grr… I refuse!
Gojou,"Don’t be shy, now. You’re making me embarrassed, too."
[Action: Gojou grabs Jougo’s hand.],
Jougo,Grr… Damn you!
[Action: Gojou punches Jougo in the stomach.],
Jougo,"Erk!

Gah!

(Thoughts) He’s fast! It’s not just a blow strengthened by cursed energy!

(Thoughts) What is this? I don’t get it! I have to know!"
Gojou,There’s still more!
[Action: Gojou continues to beat Jougo.],
Jougo,Ngh… Guh… Gahhh!
Gojou,"Infinity exists everywhere.

My jujutsu just brings it forward in reality.

Convergence, divergence… What do you think happens when one touches this void?

Cursed Technique Reversal: Red."
Jougo,Ngh…
[Action: Jougo is blasted away by Gojou’s technique.],
Jougo,"Ngh… Gah…

Gahh…"
"[Action: Jougo tries to run, but Gojou continues to beat him.]",
Jougo,"Ugh!

Urahhh!

Ugh! Gahh!"
[Action: Gojou kicks Jougo into a lake.],
Gojou,"Oh, this is perfect."
Kenjaku,"(Flashback) You can try, but you’ll die, Jougo."
Jougo,"(Thoughts) It wasn’t just talk.

Heh… Hehehehe…

(Thoughts) No matter. If I can’t hit him, I’ll just drag him into my Domain.

(Thoughts) Where did he go?"
[Action: Gojou arrives back with Itadori in tow.],
Gojou,Sorry about that.
Jougo,Huh?
Itadori,"Where the heck?! Hey, where are we?! Huh?!"
Gojou,Were you waiting?
Itadori,Huh?! Huh?!
Jougo,"That’s…

(Thoughts) … Sukuna’s vessel?!"
Gojou,"This is Itadori Yuuji-kun, and he’s here to watch."
Itadori,Mt. Fuji! His head’s Mt. Fuji!
[Scene: A few moments prior. Gojou arrives at the secluded room as Itadori watches a movie and the puppet sleeps peacefully.],
Men,"(Flashback) “I’ll protect you… I’ll never leave you!”

(Flashback) “Sam…”"
Gojou,"(Past Thoughts) Wow, he learns surprisingly quick."
Man,(Flashback) “Come on.”
Gojou,(Flashback) Yuuji!
Itadori,"(Flashback) Ahh!

(Flashback) Gojou-sensei!"
Gojou,"(Past Thoughts) Talking to him doesn’t cause a problem, either."
Itadori,(Flashback) You need something?
Gojou,"(Past Thoughts) Looks like we’ll be able to increase his output quickly and move on to the next stage soon.

(Flashback) We’re heading out, Yuuji."
Itadori,(Flashback) Huh?!
Gojou,"(Flashback) It’s an extracurricular lesson.

(Flashback) I’m going to teach you about the pinnacle of jujutsu battles, Domain Expansion."
[Scene: In the present. Itadori steps forward tentatively.],
Itadori,"Why aren’t we sinking?

Sensei, I was at the school just ten seconds ago, right? What’s going on here?"
Gojou,"Oh, we warped here."
Itadori,(Thoughts) He has no intention of explaining.
Jougo,(Thoughts) Sukuna’s vessel… So he really is alive.
Kenjaku,"(Flashback) You have to render Gojou Satoru incapable of fighting.

(Flashback) The second is to get Ryoumen Sukuna and Itadori Yuuji on your side."
Jougo,"(Thoughts) I can’t kill Itadori due to our future plans. Has he caught on to our goals?

What’s the brat for? He a shield?"
Gojou,"A shield? No, no. I told you, here’s here to watch.

I’m in the middle of teaching this boy lots of things.

Don’t worry about him. Just keep fighting."
Jougo,Bringing in someone who will slow you down just makes you a fool.
Gojou,Hahahaha! It’ll be fine. After all… you’re weak. Heh…
Jougo,Ngh… Grrr…
[Action: Fire explodes from Jougo’s head.],
Jougo,"Don’t underestimate me, brat! I’m going to enjoy swallowing up that smug face of yours!"
Itadori,"Ngh…

(Thoughts) This guy… is weak?

(Thoughts) He’s way more dangerous than any of the monsters I’ve encountered so far…"
[Action: Gojou pats Itadori’s head.],
Itadori,Ah…
Gojou,You’ll be fine. Just stay close to me.
Jougo,Domain Expansion!
[Action: Jougo’s domain expands to cover the area.],
Itadori,"Ah… Ngh… Ah…

Ah…"
"[Action: The ground cracks, and the area becomes the inside of a volcano.]",
Itadori,Ahh…!
Jougo,Fufu…
Itadori,Wh-What is this?!
Jougo,Coffin of the Iron Mountain!
,
,
,
[Scene: In Jougo’s domain. Itadori worries while Gojou remains calm.],
Itadori,Wh-What is this?
Gojou,This is Domain Expansion.
Jougo,Fufufufu…
Gojou,You use cursed energy to construct an Innate Domain imbued with a cursed technique in your surroundings.
[Action: Fire hits Itadori’s hand.],
Itadori,"Ow, hot! Hot, hot, hot!"
Gojou,"What you all experienced at the juvenile detention center was an incomplete Domain that hadn’t been imbued with any cursed techniques.

If that had been a proper Domain, all of you first-years would have died.

I think Megumi understood that.

Spreading out a Domain consumes a ton of energy, but its merits are worth the cost. One such benefit is the boost to stats due to environmental factors."
Itadori,Oh! Like buffs in video games!
Gojou,There’s one more thing.
[Action: Gojou destroys a boulder heading his way.],
Jougo,"Grr…

(Thoughts) Most sorcerers would have burned to ash the moment they entered my Domain!"
Gojou,The techniques imbued in the Domain are guaranteed to hit within that Domain.
Itadori,Guaranteed?!
Gojou,"Guaranteed!

But don’t worry. There are several ways to deal with it.

You can take the hit using a cursed technique, just like now, or… I don’t really recommend this one, but you can go outside the Domain. That’s usually impossible.

You can also…"
Jougo,"If I neutralize that Infinity of yours with a dense Domain, then my techniques will reach you."
Gojou,"Yeah, they’ll hit."
Itadori,Huh? Infinity?
Jougo,"(Flashback) Give me the Prison Realm!

(Flashback) I’ll add it to my collection.

(Thoughts) I came here half in jest. I thought I wouldn’t care if I couldn’t kill him. But having this difference between us thrust in my face… on my pride as a cursed spirit, as the new humanity, this is completely unacceptable!"
Gojou,"The most effective way to deal with a Domain… is to lay out your own Domain. When two Domains are laid out at the same time, the more refined one will dominate that space. Though sometimes, compatibility and the amount of cursed energy are factors."
[Action: Gojou takes off his blindfold.],
Jougo,"There won’t even be ashes left of you, Gojou Satoru!"
[Action: Jougo prepares to burn Itadori and Gojou.],
Itadori,Ngh!
Gojou,Domain Expansion: Infinite Void.
"[Action: Gojou’s domain expands, completely erasing Jougo’s domain.]",
Jougo,"(Thoughts) What just happened? Was my Domain overwhelmed?

(Thoughts) I can’t see anything. I can’t feel anything.

(Thoughts) No… I can see everything! I can feel everything! But the information is never complete!

(Thoughts) I can’t do anything!"
[Action: Gojou puts his hand on Jougo’s head.],
Gojou,"This is the inner world of Limitless.

Perception, communication… Every action involved in living is forcibly carried out an infinite number of times."
Jougo,Ngh…
Gojou,"It’s ironic, isn’t it? When granted everything, you can’t do anything but just die peacefully.

But I have questions I want to ask you, so I’m letting you off the hook with this."
[Action: Gojou rips Jougo’s head off. The domain breaks. Gojou steps on Jougo’s head.],
Gojou,"Now, who told you to come after me?"
Itadori,"(Thoughts) He really is the strongest jujutsu sorcerer! As a living organism, he’s on another level!"
"[Action: From a mountain above, Kenjaku and Hanami watch the fight.]",
Kenjaku,"Oh, dear. What now? Will you rescue him?

I can’t let people from the school see my face, so I’ll be going home now.

If you want to save him, go ahead and save him. Though I don’t know if your kind have such emotions."
[Action: Hanami says incomprehensible words. Kenjaku walks off. Hanami jumps away.],
Kenjaku,Quite the statement for a cursed spirit to make.
[Action: Gojou continues to step on Jougo’s head.],
Gojou,"You don’t seem like the type to act on orders.

Was something good supposed to happen if you killed me?

Regardless, I want to know. Who was it?

Come on, just tell me already."
Jougo,"Ngh… Like I’d ever tell you, brat!"
Gojou,You sure you should be saying that?
Jougo,Ngh… Damn you!
Gojou,"Hurry up and tell me, or I’ll exorcize you. Of course, I’ll do that either way."
Itadori,"Wait, curses are capable of holding conversations? It seemed so normal, I overlooked it."
Gojou,Wha…
[Action: Hanami’s flower plants into the ground near Gojou.],
Jougo,Ngh!
Itadori,Ah…
[Action: A bunch of flowers sprout from the ground.],
Gojou,Wow!
Itadori,Flowers!
Gojou,Pretty!
Jougo,Ngh…
Gojou,Fufufufu… Ah!
[Action: Gojou slaps his face.],
Gojou,"(Thoughts) That is a curse, right? It’s stripping away my will to fight."
[Action: A tree root wraps around Itadori’s leg and lifts him into the air.],
Itadori,Woah!
Gojou,Ngh… Ah…
[Action: Hanami grabs Jougo’s head and runs.],
Itadori,"Sensei, I’ll be fine! Go after him!"
[Action: A tree mouth opens up in the ground.],
Itadori,"Sorry, I lied! Help!"
[Action: Gojou cuts the tree root and lights the tree on fire. Itadori falls to the ground.],
Itadori,Gah!
Gojou,"Wow…

(Thoughts) He got away. He’s good at hiding his presence.

(Thoughts) He’s way creepier than Volcano Head."
[Action: Itadori puts his face to the ground and bows.],
Itadori,I’m sorry about that.
Gojou,"So cursed spirits of that level are forming a faction now? This is getting interesting!

Yuuji. I want you -- or rather, everyone -- to become strong enough to beat that."
Itadori,Huh? Beat that? 
Gojou,"It’s better to have a concrete goal, right? Man, I’m glad I brought you here!"
Itadori,"I had no idea what was going on, though. Are you serious?"
Gojou,"Now that we’ve set your goal, all that’s left is to pursue it. We’ll speed up the schedule a bit. For the next month, you’ll be watching movies and fighting me."
Itadori,"Fighting you?

Hmm… Will I still be alive a month from now?"
Gojou,"After that, it’s practical combat. You’ll take on and complete several harder missions.

You’ll learn the basics and how to apply them, and then you’ll show them off at the Exchange Event!"
Itadori,"Hey, Sensei!"
Gojou,"Yes, Yuuji-kun?"
Itadori,What’s the Exchange Event?
Gojou,Huh? I didn’t tell you?
,
[Scene: At a restaurant. Yaga waits impatiently for Gojou as Ijichi worries.],
Yaga,Hmm…
Ijichi,Err… Ahh…
Yaga,Hmm…
Ijichi,Err… Erk…
Yaga,He’s late!
Ijichi,Eek!

"[Scene: At an apartment. Kenjaku returns to the curse hideout, which is in Dagon’s domain.]",
Kenjaku,Sure is peaceful here.
Mahito,"How’s Jougo doing, Getou?"
Kenjaku,"On death’s door. Hanami stepped in to save him, so he’ll probably be fine."
Mahito,How irresponsible. You’re the one who egged him on.
Kenjaku,"Heavens, no. I tried to stop him."
[Action: Hanami returns with Jougo’s head.],
Mahito,"Speak of the devil.

Jougo, Hanami. Glad to see you’re safe."
Jougo,How can you say that when you see me like this?!
Kenjaku,You’re lucky you got off with just that.
Jougo,"Grr… Why, you…"
Kenjaku,"I think you understand now, so we’ll go about sealing Gojou Satoru at the appropriate time, in the appropriate place, once we’ve secured our advantage over him.

We’ll carry it out on October 31st in Shibuya. I’ll contact you with more details later.

Good enough, Mahito?"
Mahito,"No objections here.

Let’s be cunning about this… like curses should. Like humans should. Fufu…"
[Scene: At Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School. Kugisaki ponders over which drink to get.],
Kugisaki,Hmm… Mm.
[Action: Kugisaki gets her drink.],
Kugisaki,Couldn’t they put in a few more vending machines?!
Fushiguro,They can’t. There are only so many workers who can come in here.
,
"[Scene: In a forested area. Maki, Panda, and Inumaki walk around.]",
Panda,"Huh?

Where are the first-years?"
Maki,On errands.
Inumaki,Bonito flakes.
Panda,Ahh… Will they be okay?
Inumaki,Salmon.
Maki,They’re not three years old. They can handle an errand run.
Panda,"No, that’s not what I mean. It’s today, right? The day Kyoto’s principal comes."
Maki,Huh?
Panda,To go over the Exchange Event.
Inumaki,Tuna.
Panda,"Satoru’s fighting with the higher-ups because they arranged for the first-years to get dispatched on that special-grade case, right?

And the principal of Kyoto is one of those higher-ups, isn’t he? So if they run into each other…"
Maki,"The first-year they were targeting, Itadori, is dead. I doubt he has any plans to do anything about the other two.

Besides, the old man from Kyoto won’t cause a scene in broad daylight."
Inumaki,Salmon.
Panda,"An instructor might have his position to worry about, but that’s not the case for the students."
Maki,Are you saying Mai is coming?
Panda,"It’s just a guess. Students aren’t necessary for a meeting.

But still… they love harassing us, right? Both Toudou and Mai."
,
[Scene: Near the vending machines. Toudou and Mai approach Fushiguro and Kugisaki.],
Fushiguro,"What are you doing here, Zenin-senpai?"
Kugisaki,"Oh, she’s one, too?

They do seem similar. Are they sisters?"
Fushiguro,They’re twins.
Mai,"Don’t call me that, Fushiguro-kun. You make me sound the same as Maki.

Call me Mai."
Toudou,So these are the pinch-hitters for Okkotsu and the third-years?
Mai,"We came here with the principal because we were worried about you. Your classmate died, right? Was that rough? Or did you think nothing of it?"
"Fushiguro, Kugisaki",Ngh…
Fushiguro,What are you trying to say?
Mai,"It’s okay. Some things are hard to say out loud, so I’ll say it for you.

“Vessel” makes it sound nice, but it just means he was a half-curse monster.

Having such a tainted inhuman being beside you brazenly calling himself a jujutsu sorcerer must have been revolting, right? Aren’t you feeling better now that he’s dead?"
Fushiguro,Ugh…
Kugisaki,Ngh…
Toudou,"Mai, don’t bring up such pointless topics."
Mai,Huh?
[Action: Toudou walks toward Fushiguro.],
Toudou,I’m only here to see if these guys are fit to take Okkotsu’s place. That’s all I want to know!
Fushiguro,Ngh…
Toudou,"Fushiguro, was it?

What kind of woman is your type?!"
"Fushiguro, Kugisaki",Huh?
Toudou,"Depending on your answer, I’ll beat you half to death right here and drag Okkotsu, or at least the third-years, out to the Exchange Event.

By the way, my type is a tall woman with a big ass!"
,
,
,
[Scene: At Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School. Toudou prepares to fight Fushiguro.],
Fushiguro,Why do I have to talk about my taste in women with a guy I just met?
Toudou,Hm?
Kugisaki,He’s right. That’s a tall hurdle for an antisocial guy.
Fushiguro,You be quiet. This is confusing enough already. You’ll just make it more complicated.
Toudou,"Kyoto, third-year, Toudou Aoi! Introduction over.

Now we’re friends. Hurry up and answer. If you prefer men, that’s fine, too.

A person’s fetishes reflect everything about them. People with boring taste in women are boring people themselves!

And I hate boring men!

The Exchange Event is where my soul can be free as blood boils and flesh clashes.

Who knows what I might do if my last Exchange Event ends up boring me?"
Kugisaki,"Hey, aren’t the Jujutsu Tech schools four-year schools?"
Fushiguro,Only third-years and under can join the Exchange Event.
Kugisaki,Huh…
Toudou,"As a show of kindness, I’ll let you off only half-dead right now. Answer me, Fushiguro. What kind of woman is your type?"
Fushiguro,Is this some kind of comedy routine?
Kugisaki,"Is that your summer uniform?

Ticks me off, but it’s nice."
Fushiguro,(Thoughts) Kugisaki’s unarmed. I’d rather avoid confrontation.
Tsumiki,"(Flashback) Not forgiving people isn’t a bad thing. That’s just part of your kindness, isn’t it?"
Fushiguro,"I don’t have a particular preference. As long as she has unshakable character, I won’t ask for more."
Mai,Fufu…
Kugisaki,"Not a bad answer. If you had said something like “big boobs”, I’d have killed you."
Fushiguro,Shut up.
[Action: A tear falls down Toudou’s cheek.],
Toudou,"Haa… I knew it.

You’re boring, Fushiguro."
Fushiguro,Ah…
Toudou,Ngh!
Fushiguro,Erk…!
"[Action: Toudou launches forward. Fushiguro blocks, but Toudou brings his arm across Fushiguro’s block, sending him flying across the courtyard.]",
Toudou,Ngh!
Fushiguro,Ugh! Ngh…
Kugisaki,Ah… Fushiguro!
"[Action: Kugisaki tries to go to Fushiguro, but Mai stops her.]",
Mai,"Oh, dear… Poor Fushiguro-kun."
Kugisaki,Ngh…
Mai,Even a talented second-grade jujutsu sorcerer is nothing more than a first-year against the top-grade Toudou-senpai. I’ll have to comfort him later.
Kugisaki,"I thought you two were similar, but that’s not the case at all. Maki-san’s a hundred times prettier."
Mai,Hm?
Kugisaki,Are you not sleeping enough? You’ve got open pores.
Mai,Ngh… I’ll teach you…
[Action: Mai puts her gun to Kugisaki’s stomach.],
Mai,… how to speak to others.
Fushiguro,Ngh…
[Action: Toudou approaches Fushiguro.],
Toudou,"I knew at first glance that you were a boring guy. But you shouldn’t judge a person by their looks, right?

So I went out of my way to ask you… but you just trampled on my kindness. Ngh…"
Fushiguro,"Is your brain as much of a pineapple as your head?

(Thoughts) Toudou… That Toudou?

(Thoughts) The one involved in last year’s unprecedented jujutsu terror attack caused by the curse user Getou -- the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons from Kyoto to Shinjuku? The one who exorcized a special-grade and five first-grade cursed spirits by himself when the parade appeared in Kyoto? That Toudou?

(Thoughts) Still, there are several first-grade sorcerers capable of beating a second-grade. What’s shocking is…

I heard you don’t use cursed techniques."
Toudou,"Huh? Oh, that rumor’s false.

I used them against the special-grade."
Fushiguro,"(Thoughts) He doesn’t use them against first-grades?! Is he a monster?!

That’s a relief to hear!

Nue… plus Gama."
[Action: Fushiguro summons several toads with wings.],
Fushiguro,Bottomless Well.
Toudou,Hmm?
Fushiguro,(Thoughts) I’m up against a hardcore close-range fighter. I’ll keep my distance and restrain him!
Toudou,Ngh!
[Action: Toudou knocks Fushiguro’s toads away instantly and gets behind Fushiguro.],
Fushiguro,(Thoughts) He’s fast! That wasn’t his full speed earlier?!
[Action: Toudou grabs Fushiguro’s waist.],
Toudou,Flimsy and shallow… Both your body and your taste in women!
[Action: Toudou lifts Fushiguro over his head and slams him into the ground.],
Fushiguro,Ngh! Ah!
[Action: Toudou continues his assault.],
Fushiguro,Ngh! Ah…
Toudou,Urgh!
Fushiguro,"Ngh… Ngh…

Ngh… Ugh…"
Toudou,Fufufufu!
Fushiguro,(Thoughts) Damn it! His power is insane!
Toudou,Fufu…
Fushiguro,Ngh…
Toudou,Grr… Urah!
[Action: Toudou slams Fushiguro’s head into a wall.],
Fushiguro,Ngh… Ugh…
Toudou,I’m not finished yet!
[Action: Toudou continues pushing Fushiguro through the building.],
Fushiguro,Ugh!
Toudou,You’re always so boring!
[Action: Fushiguro’s toads grab Toudou with their tongues. Toudou kicks one away.],
Toudou,"Ugh… Ngh…

I barely feel any intention to fight."
Fushiguro,"I’ve been holding back, and you’re so proud?

If you’re going to insist like that… then I’ll show you."
Toudou,Ah… Fufufu… Bring it!
Inumaki,Don’t move.
[Action: Toudou freezes in place.],
Toudou,Ngh…
Panda,What are you two doing?!
[Action: Panda punches Toudou away.],
Toudou,Ngh!
Panda,"Whew, just barely safe."
Inumaki,Bonito flakes.
Fushiguro,Haa…
Panda,"Okay, I guess that might actually be an out."
Toudou,"Long time no see, Panda."
Panda,"Why can’t you just wait until the Exchange Event?

Go home, or I’ll start screaming, “No!”"
Toudou,"You don’t have to tell me to go home.

Where’d I put my jacket?

Looks like I won’t be bored the whole time."
Fushiguro,What?
Toudou,"Give Okkotsu a message for me: “You take part, too.”"
Panda,"(Thoughts) What a pain.

I panda. I no understand human speech."
Inumaki,Salmon.
[Action: Kugisaki lies on the ground. Mai restocks her gun and points it at Kugisaki.],
Mai,"If you want to continue as a jujutsu sorcerer, learn to choose who you pick a fight with. 

Fufu…"
[Action: Maki uses her polearm to move Mai’s gun away.],
Mai,Huh?
Maki,"What are you doing to our errand runner, Mai?"
Mai,"Oh, my. You’re such a loser that I didn’t even notice you, Maki."
Maki,"We’re both equally losers, you know. All you can do is imbue objects with cursed energy, and you’ve got shit for cursed techniques."
Mai,"Better than having no cursed energy at all. My neck gets sore looking up at others all the time, so I need to look down on someone like you every so often."
Maki,"Ah, forget it. We’re both at rock bottom, and it’s pathetic.

Nobara, can you stand?"
Mai,No way. She won’t be getting up for a while. I hurt her pretty good…
[Action: Maki points her polearm at Mai.],
Mai,What? You want to fight?
[Action: Kugisaki gets up and gets Mai in a headlock.],
Kugisaki,Ngh!
Mai,Ugh… Ngh!
Kugisaki,"Ngh… Nice support, Maki-san!"
Mai,Ngh… Ugh…
Kugisaki,You put a bunch of holes in my brand-new tracksuit! Leave that uniform of yours behind. I’ll make it my own summer uniform!
Mai,"Ngh… I’ll put holes in your body next time. Also, you wouldn’t be able to wear this with those long legs of yours --"
[Action: Kugisaki squeezes down harder on Mai’s throat.],
Mai,Ngh…
Kugisaki,Ngh… Leave it!
Toudou,"We’re leaving, Mai."
Kugisaki,"Ah…

What? No way…"
Toudou,"Oh, there’s my jacket."
[Action: Kugisaki gets off Mai.],
Kugisaki,Where’s Fushiguro?
Maki,Don’t worry. The others are with him.
Toudou,Looks like you’re having fun.
Mai,Ngh… Quit joking! I’m just getting started!
Toudou,"No, you’re not."
Mai,Ngh…
Toudou,"Unlike you, I still have important business here in Tokyo.

My personal handshake with Takada-chan!"
"Kugisaki, Maki, Mai",Uh-huh…
Toudou,"Who knows what I might do if I miss my transfer and can’t make it to the event hall?

Come with me, Mai!"
Mai,Ugh! You’re so selfish!
[Action: Toudou and Mai begin walking away.],
Toudou,I can’t believe I lost the lottery for the usual one in Kyoto.
Mai,Don’t go thinking you’ll get off this easy at the Exchange Event!
Kugisaki,"Quit acting like you won! Leave your uniform behind, damn it!"
[Action: Maki taps Kugisaki on the head with her polearm.],
Maki,"Cut it out, idiot. Winning or losing here hardly matters. We’ll beat them up at the Exchange Event."
[Action: Kugisaki and Mai move to find Ieiri.],
Kugisaki,"Hey, Maki-san… Is what she said true? That you don’t have cursed energy?"
Maki,"It’s true.

So I can’t even see curses without these glasses.

That’s why I use cursed tools. They already have curses imbued in them.

I can’t pour my own cursed energy into them to do things like you all do."
Kugisaki,"Ah…

(Thoughts) Like that thing he gave Itadori?

Then why are you a jujutsu sorcerer?"
Maki,"To spite them.

I can’t wait to see the looks on my family’s faces when I become a bigshot sorcerer after all the years they’ve spent looking down on me."
Kugisaki,Ah…
Maki,"Come on, let’s hurry over to see Shouko-san!"
Kugisaki,"I respect you, Maki-san!"
Maki,That so?

[Scene: At Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School. Gakuganji waits for a meeting with Yaga.],
Gakuganji,Is Yaga here yet? The time of an old man close to death doesn’t come cheap.
[Action: Gojou enters the room.],
Miwa,Huh?
Gojou,Principal Yaga won’t be coming for a while.
Gakuganji,Oh?
[Action: Gojou sits across from Gakuganji.],
Gojou,"Haa…

He was given a false schedule.

(Thoughts) After some threats to Ijichi.

Thank you for the other day, Principal Gakuganji."
Gakuganji,Oh? What other day would that be?
Gojou,"Don’t play dumb with me, old man. I’m referring to the case with Itadori Yuuji. As head of the conservatives, you were involved, too, correct?"
Gakuganji,"What? My goodness, youth these days… Don’t you know how to be polite?"
Gojou,"I never had any intention of respecting you. Elders these days love to act important, and it’s so annoying, honestly."
Miwa,Hey.
Gojou,Hm?
Miwa,"Your conduct is problematic. I’ll be reporting you to the relevant authorities.

(Thoughts) Oh, man! It’s Gojou Satoru in person! Gojou Satoru in person!"
Gojou,Feel free. I don’t plan to chat for long.
Miwa,"Ngh…

(Thoughts) He spoke! He spoke to me!"
Gojou,"Last night, I was attacked by two unregistered special-grade cursed spirits."
Gakuganji,Oh? That is unfortunate.
Gojou,"Don’t get me wrong here. To me, it was about like being coerced into taking a survey in the city."
Miwa,(Thoughts) Ugh! So cool!
Gojou,"The two cursed spirits were capable of communication, and they probably have allies who are just as strong.

It’s not just our enemies, either. Hakari, Okkotsu, and your Toudou… The level of our students has risen dramatically in recent years, as well.

Then there was last year’s incident with Getou Suguru… And now, the appearance of Sukuna’s vessel."
Gakuganji,What are you trying to say?
Gojou,"Hehe… You don’t know?

The wave of power you guys have been trying to hold back with your pointless status and traditions has grown bigger than you can handle and is now descending upon us.

You won’t be able to measure the coming age with the classification of “special-grade”.

If you think I’m the only one who’ll be fighting back, you’re going to get hurt, old man."
Gakuganji,I think you are getting a bit out of line.
Gojou,"Oh, scary!

Well, that’s all I wanted to say. I’ll be going now."
[Action: Gojou leaves the room.],
Miwa,Ah…
[Action: Gojou pops back into the room.],
Miwa,Woah!
Gojou,"Oh, Principal Yaga will be coming in about two hours. Later!"
[Action: Gojou leaves again.],
Miwa,(Thoughts) Two hours?!
Gakuganji,"Haa… Miwa, would you go buy me some tea?"
Miwa,"Yes, sir."
[Action: Miwa leaves the room.],
Miwa,Excuse me.
[Action: Miwa begins running down the hall.],
Miwa,"Fufufufu!

(Thoughts) If I can catch up to him, I’ll get him to take a picture with me!"
,
[Scene: At the Takada-chan handshake event. Toudou shakes hands with Takeda.],
Toudou,"Give me a Taka-tan Beam, please."
Takada,"Okay, here I go!

Tan, Taka-tan!"
Crowd,Woah…
Toudou,Ahh…
Man,Time’s up.
[Action: A man pushes Toudou out of the way.],
,
"[Scene: One month later, outside the Kinema Cinema. Yoshino approaches Mahito.]",
Yoshino,Excuse me… Did you do that… in the theater?
Mahito,"Heh…

Wow. You can see me?"
Yoshino,Ngh…
,
[Scene: Sometime later. Itadori and Nanami arrive at the theater.],
Nanami,"It’s a gruesome sight.

Are you ready to witness it, Itadori-kun?"
Itadori,Ngh…
,
,
,
[Scene: At the Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School. Miwa gets her photo with Gojou.],
Miwa,Fufufufu… Thank you very much!
Gojou,You’re welcome.
[Action: Miwa runs back to the room that Gakuganji waits in.],
Miwa,I got a photo! Hehehehe… Hohohoho…
[Action: Miwa enters the waiting room and goes back to her position.],
Gakuganji,My tea?
Miwa,Ah!
"[Scene: In the past, behind a school building. A girl complains that Yoshino was staring at her.]",
Girl,(Flashback) He was totally ogling my breasts!
Boy,(Flashback) Ngh!
[Action: A boy punches Yoshino.],
Yoshino,"(Flashback) Ngh…

(Flashback) Ugh…"
Boy,"(Flashback) She does have a huge rack, so they bounce when she runs!"
Yoshino,(Flashback) Ugh…
Boys,"(Flashback) Hahahaha!

(Flashback) I get why you’d do it, Yoshino-chan.

(Flashback) Hahahaha!"
Yoshino,"(Past Thoughts) If there was a button that would make everyone I hate die, I probably wouldn’t push it."
Girl,(Flashback) Gross!
Yoshino,(Past Thoughts) But if there was a button that would make everyone who hated me die… I’d push it without hesitation.
[Scene: At the theater. Yoshino goes to see a movie.],
Yoshino,"Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Excuse me!"
Woman,Huh?
Yoshino,One adult for “Human Earthworm 3”.
Woman,"That’ll be 1,800 yen."
Yoshino,"Yeah, here."
[Action: Yoshino pays the cashier. Mahito walks past Yoshino.],
Woman,The show will be starting soon.
[Action: Yoshino goes to watch the movie.],
Man,"“I served as a doctor for many years, working to save lives."
Boy,"Hahahaha!

And it turned out he had 50,000 on him! A middle school brat!"
Man,“As I was saving countless lives…”
Boys,"Really?

That’s awesome!"
Yoshino,(Thoughts) This sucks.
Boy,Hehehehe… So? What’d you do next?
Yoshino,(Thoughts) High schoolers shouldn’t skip school to watch movies.
Boys,"I took it all.

Man, so mean! Haha!"
Yoshino,(Thoughts) Not that I can talk.
Man,“That’s when I realized it!”
Boys,Hahahaha!
Yoshino,(Thoughts) This seriously sucks.
Boy,Then today’s your treat!
Yoshino,(Thoughts) I can’t hear the movie at all.
Boy,Screw that!
Yoshino,"(Thoughts) There are always people like that, even if they vary to some degree."
"[Scene: In the past, behind the school building. The boys continue to bully Yoshino.]",
Boy,"(Flashback) So, where were you looking?"
Yoshino,(Flashback) I wasn’t.
[Action: The boy kicks Yoshino.],
Yoshino,(Flashback) Ngh…
Boy,(Flashback) Then are you saying Tsubasa’s lying to us?!
Girl,(Flashback) He was definitely looking at them!
Boys,"(Flashback) Haha! You’re nuts, man!

(Flashback) Oh, there’s a half-off coupon.

(Flashback) Huh? To where?"
Girl,(Flashback) Hey! Teach him a lesson first!
Yoshino,"(Past Thoughts) Shit… That woman’s just using me to see where she stands, and she’s enjoying it!"
Boy,"(Flashback) You were looking, then."
[Action: The boy kicks Yoshino again.],
Yoshino,"(Flashback) Ngh… Ngh…

(Past Thoughts) Damn it!

(Past Thoughts) I’ll tell her… I’ll tell her… I’ll tell her… I’ll tell her!

(Flashback) You’re not as cute as you think you are, Tsubasa-san.

(Flashback) These three know that, too. The only reason they’re fawning over you is… because they think you’ll let them bang you."
[Scene: In the present. Yoshino continues to sit at the theater.],
Man,“Now to create the perfect human being!”
Boy,No way! She won’t let us bang her at all. She’s no good anymore.
Yoshino,(Thoughts) Stop talking!
Woman,“S-Stop it!”
[Action: One of the boy’s phones rings.],
Woman,“No!”
Boy,It’s Tsubasa.
Yoshino,(Thoughts) Turn off your phone!
Boy,Hello? What’s up?
Woman,“Ahhh!”
[Action: Mahito appears behind the boys.],
Mahito,Fufu…
Boy,Right now? I’m free.
Mahito,You three…
Boy,Well…
Mahito,… need to mind your manners.
Boy,Ah…
"[Action: Mahito touches a boy’s face, which becomes disfigured.]",
Man,“There’s no need to worry. Everything went well. It’s all for the creation of the perfect human being…”
"[Action: The movie finishes. When the lights turn on, Yoshino sees the disfigured bodies of the three boys.]",
Yoshino,"Wha… What is this?

Ah…

Ngh…"
[Action: Yoshino runs out of the theater.],
Yoshino,"(Thoughts) That person just now… No, a person couldn’t do this.

(Thoughts) And if they could, would they really be human?"
[Scene: In the alleyway. Yoshino finds Mahito.],
Mahito,What if I am the one who did it? Will you condemn me?
Yoshino,Ah…
Mahito,Were those three special to you?
Yoshino,Ahh…
[Scene: In the past. Yoshino sits beaten and bloodied.],
Boys,"(Flashback) Don’t worry. He can eat it!

(Flashback) Harsh, man!"
Girl,(Flashback) Poor guy! He’s crying now!
Yoshino,(Flashback) Ngh…
"Boys, Girl",(Flashback) Hahahaha!
Yoshino,(Flashback) Ngh!
[Scene: In the present. It begins to rain.],
Yoshino,"Can I… do that, too?"
,
,
,
[Scene: At the theater. Policemen secure the scene.],
Policemen,"Please stay back.

It seems like the victims were high school students.

Please wait a moment."
Detectives,"Who were those guys?! Why were they on the scene before forensics?! One of them was just a kid, too!

I don’t know the details, either. But you saw those stiffs, didn’t you?

That’s not something a person could do.

Just pretend you never saw it.

Ngh…

If you want to reach retirement in this line of work, that is."
[Scene: In the theater. Itadori and Nanami investigate.],
Nanami,Can you see it? This is the residual taint of cursed energy.
Itadori,"No, I can’t see anything."
Nanami,"That’s because you’re not trying to see it. We typically see curses as if it’s perfectly natural to.

When a cursed technique is used, it leaves traces behind. That’s what residuals are. But residuals are much fainter than cursed spirits, so focus your vision and look closely."
Itadori,Hmm…
[Action: Itadori focuses and sees footprints leading out of the theater.],
Itadori,Oh! I can see them!
Nanami,Of course you can.
Itadori,Haha!
Nanami,A proper sorcerer can sense them before seeing them.
Itadori,Erk… Ngh…
[Action: Itadori and Nanami follow the footprints.],
Itadori,Couldn’t you give me a little more praise or something?
Nanami,"I don’t praise or disparage anyone. I adhere to facts and judge on that basis. That’s who I am.

There was a time when I mistakenly believed society operated the same way, but enough about that.

Let’s follow them."
Itadori,Yeah! Let’s go all-out!
Nanami,"No, where moderate effort will suffice, use moderate effort."
Itadori,Ah…
Nanami,Let’s go.
Itadori,"Ahh…

(Thoughts) We’re just not clicking. I’m not getting anything from him."
[Scene: In the past. Gojou leads Itadori to a room.],
Gojou,"(Flashback) I won’t be able to lead you this time.

(Flashback) But don’t worry. I’ve called in a friend you can trust."
[Action: Gojou opens the door and puts his arm around Nanami’s shoulders.],
Gojou,"(Flashback) This is Nanami Kento, the ex-salaryman jujutsu sorcerer!"
Nanami,(Flashback) Please don’t call me that.
Gojou,"(Flashback) Plenty of jujutsu sorcerers are oddballs, but since he worked for a company, he’s got a good head on his shoulders. He’s a first-grade sorcerer, too."
Nanami,(Flashback) I’m sure no one would want to hear you saying that about them.
Itadori,"(Past Thoughts) A lot of these people wear sunglasses and stuff to hide their eyes.

(Flashback) Ex-salaryman? Why didn’t you become a jujutsu sorcerer from the start?"
Nanami,"(Flashback) We should greet each other first. Nice to meet you, Itadori-kun."
[Action: Nanami bows.],
Itadori,"(Flashback) Oh, yes, nice to meet you, too."
[Action: Itadori bows.],
Nanami,"(Flashback) I studied at Jujutsu Tech, and one thing I learned… is that jujutsu sorcerers are shit!"
Itadori,(Flashback) Huh?
Nanami,"(Flashback) Then I worked at your typical company, and one thing I learned is that work is shit!"
Itadori,(Flashback) Really?!
Nanami,"(Flashback) If both are equally shit, I’ll take the one I’m more suited to. That’s the only reason I came back."
Itadori,(Flashback) That’s dark.
Gojou,(Flashback) Right?
Nanami,"(Flashback) Itadori-kun, please don’t believe I’m of the same mindset as Gojou-san. I do trust and have faith in him."
Gojou,(Flashback) Fufufu…
Itadori,(Flashback) Ah…
Nanami,(Flashback) But I do not respect him!
Gojou,(Flashback) Huh?!
Nanami,"(Flashback) I hate the way the higher-ups do things, but I believe in rules and regulations.

(Flashback) This conversation is dragging on. In short, I don’t recognize you as a sorcerer, either.

(Flashback) Even if you do carry the bomb we know as Sukuna, please make an effort to prove that you are useful."
Itadori,"(Flashback) Lately, I’ve been forced to realize how weak and useless I am.

(Flashback) But I’ll become strong. I have to be strong, or I won’t be able to choose how I die."
Gojou,(Flashback) Heh…
Itadori,"(Flashback) I’ll make you recognize me, even without that advice. Just give me a bit more time."
Nanami,"(Flashback) Say that to the higher-ups, not me."
Itadori,"(Flashback) Oh, right…"
Nanami,"(Flashback) Frankly, I don’t care!"
Itadori,"(Flashback) Okay, I get it!"
[Scene: In the present. Itadori and Nanami walk upstairs.],
Itadori,"There wasn’t anything on the surveillance cameras, right?"
Nanami,Right. There was only one young man aside from the victims.
Itadori,Then a cursed spirit was behind it?
Nanami,"Well, most likely."
[Action: Itadori and Nanami make it to the rooftop.],
Nanami,"There’s a small chance the young man could have done it, but identifying him is the police’s…"
Itadori,Huh?
[Action: A curse appears nearby.],
Curse,Lu… Lu… Lu… Lunchbox!
Itadori,Ngh…
Nanami,Stop.
Itadori,Ah…
Nanami,I’ll take care of this one. You handle the one over there.
Itadori,Ah…
Curse,Good detergent…
Nanami,"If you decide you can’t beat it, please call me."
Itadori,Aren’t you taking me a bit too lightly here?
Nanami,"It’s not a matter of underestimating you or not. I am an adult, and you are a child.

I have a duty to prioritize your life over my own."
Curse,"Lu, lu, lu…"
Itadori,I’d rather you underestimate me than treat me like a kid!
Nanami,"You’ve faced several life-or-death situations, but that does not make you an adult.

Finding more fallen-out hairs on your pillow, watching your favorite stuffed bread disappear from the convenience store… The accumulation of those little despairs is what makes a person an adult."
,
,
,
[Scene: On the rooftop of the theater. Nanami fights the curse.],
Nanami,My cursed technique allows me to forcibly create a weak point on any opponent. Seven to three.
Curse,Grr… Grr…
Nanami,"Striking the point at that ratio when you draw a line along the target’s length causes a critical hit.

That allows me to deal a fair amount of damage to those ranked higher than me… and if their cursed energy is weak, I can cut them in two, even with a blunt blade."
Curse,Grr…
Itadori,Ngh… Ugh…
Nanami,"Are you listening, Itadori-kun?"
Itadori,Huh? You were talking to me?!
[Action: The curse throws Itadori into a fence.],
Itadori,Woah! Gahh! Ahhh!
Announcer,Home run!
Itadori,"Gah… Ow…

Is it okay to reveal something like that?"
Nanami,"It’s no problem to reveal that technique to that opponent. Also, all the better if revealing it misleads them."
Itadori,"(Thoughts) I want to focus on the curse, but it feels like I should be listening."
Nanami,There is merit to it. “Revealing one’s hand” is a pact that increases the effectiveness of one’s technique. Like so.
Curse,Grr… Grr… Grr… Grr!
"[Action: The curse charges at Nanami. Nanami hits it with his blade, cutting it into several pieces.]",
Curse,Ahh…
Nanami,That’s all from me.
Itadori,"Wow.

Not only is the blade he used all wrapped up, but he used the back of it to slice right through that thing."
Curse,Ahh…
Nanami,"Itadori-kun, behind you."
Itadori,Huh?
[Action: The curse punches at Itadori. Itadori blocks it.],
Itadori,Ah! Ugh! Ngh… Ugh…
Nanami,I don’t like you looking away.
Itadori,Who’s the one distracting me here?!
Curse,Detergent!
Itadori,Phew…
[Scene: In the past. Gojou spars with Itadori.],
Gojou,"(Flashback) Your cursed energy comes up a little slow, huh?"
Itadori,(Flashback) Ow… Slow?
Gojou,"(Flashback) Your cursed energy can’t keep up with your explosive power.

(Flashback) You’re still not good at amassing cursed energy, so it tends to lag behind. But that actually creates an irregular flow of cursed energy.

(Flashback) The moment after your fist strikes, your cursed energy slams in. In other words, you’re creating two impacts with every strike."
[Scene: In the present. Itadori punches at the curse with curse energy in his fists.],
Itadori,Urahh!
Curse,Eek!
[Action: The curse falls to the ground.],
Gojou,(Flashback) Divergent Fist!
Itadori,(Flashback) That’s so cool!
Gojou,(Flashback) It’s not something many can do on purpose. This’ll be a great weapon for you.
Itadori,Heh…
Nanami,"(Thoughts) His raw strength is superhuman? The initial blow has little cursed energy, but it reaches 120% of an average sorcerer’s power.

(Thoughts) Then the real blow of cursed energy flows in. It must be an unpleasant feeling for those struck by it.

(Thoughts) He has room to grow, too. If he can learn to imbue 100% of his cursed energy into 100% of his martial arts… Now I see why that man brought him to me."
Curse,L-Lu…
Nanami,"Ah… Oh, pardon me. I’ll end you now."
[Action: Nanami freezes when he notices a watch on the curse’s arm.],
Nanami,Itadori-kun!
Itadori,Ngh… Oh…
Nanami,Don’t finish it yet!
[Action: Nanami shows Itadori a picture of the arm on his phone.],
Nanami,Have a look at this.
Itadori,Hm?
Nanami,I took a photo of my opponent.
Itadori,Huh? I thought cursed spirits didn’t show up in photos.
Nanami,"Please listen calmly.

What we’ve been fighting…"
,
[Scene: Sometime later. Ieiri calls Nanami from the morgue with information on the two curses.],
Ieiri,"They’re human.

No, I guess I should call them former humans. They’re the same as the three from the theater.

The structure of their bodies was forcibly altered by a cursed technique."
Nanami,"If that was all, I would have noticed at the start. The two we fought were full of cursed energy, like cursed spirits."
Ieiri,"You’ll have to ask the culprit about their cursed technique to explain that.

Though there is evidence that their brain stems were tampered with, most likely to create a state of confusion and impaired consciousness.

If they can tamper with the brain, it might be possible for them to modify someone to be able to use cursed energy. The relationship between the brain and cursed energy is still a black box to us.

Oh, right, is Itadori listening?"
Itadori,"Oh, yeah."
Ieiri,"To sum it up, these guys died of shock from having their bodies modified.

You didn’t kill them, so don’t get the wrong idea about that."
Itadori,Right…
[Action: Nanami ends the call.],
Itadori,"Either way, the deaths of these two weigh on me just as heavily.

That said, this thing… has disgusting taste."
Nanami,"(Thoughts) This boy can get sincerely angry on another’s behalf.

Those residuals were a bluff, likely meant to lure us in.

Our foe is quite skilled. It looks like this will take more than moderate effort.

So let’s go all-out."
Itadori,Heh… Yeah!
,
[Scene: In Mahito’s hideout. Mahito explains curses to Yoshino.,
Mahito,"There are cursed spirits known as special-grade potential apparitions.

Cursed spirits are a collection of the cursed energy emitted by humans. Whether it actually exists or not, a shared image of fear makes it easy for a powerful curse to manifest."
Yoshino,A shared image of fear? You mean like famous monsters and ghost stories?
Mahito,Yep.
[Action: Mahito shows a book to Yoshino.],
Mahito,"Like Toilet-bound Hanako-san, the nine-tailed fox, and so on.

Jujutsu sorcerers have registered them as special-grade potential apparitions and keep an eye out for them.

The fact that they often categorize powerful, unidentified curses as potential apparitions makes it feel like that’s all they’re focused on.

But people constantly fear more than just those fairy tales, right?"
Yoshino,Like natural disasters?
Mahito,Fufu… I love how stress-free talking to you is.
Yoshino,"Ah… No, I’m not…"
Curses,Urahhh…
Yoshino,Ah…
Mahito,People…
Yoshino,Ah…
Mahito,"… have always feared the earth, the forests, and the oceans.

Because the cursed energy directed toward those is far too big, they gained wisdom before they took shape and remained in hiding up until now.

I’m proud to call them all friends."
[Action: Mahito strokes Yoshino’s face.],
Yoshino,"What kind of curse are you, Mahito-san?"
Mahito,"A human one.

I’m a curse that was born from the hatred and fear people hold in their gut toward others."
Curses,Urahhh!
,
[Scene: At a detached office. Nanami gives Itadori a rundown.],
Nanami,"I’ve organized the reports from our windows on recent residuals, unnatural deaths, and disappearances.

This should help us narrow down the culprit’s hideout to some extent."
Itadori,Aw yeah! Are we storming in?!
Nanami,"No, it’s still only to some extent. While I continue investigating this matter, I’d like you to handle a different task."
[Action: Nanami pins a photo of Yoshino to the wall.],
Nanami,"This is the boy who was at the theater, Yoshino Junpei. Apparently, he goes to the same school as the victims.

Based on the surveillance footage and how he carried himself, I believe it was unlikely he could be a curse user.

However, if he’s related to the victims, that changes things."
Itadori,Curse user?
Nanami,"An evil jujutsu sorcerer. I’ve entrusted the process to Ijichi-kun, so I’d like you two to investigate Yoshino Junpei."
[Action: Itadori and Ijichi salute.],
Itadori,Sure! Speaking of which…
Ijichi,Hm?
Itadori,… I don’t know any assistants other than you.
Ijichi,"Well, I’m the only one who knows you’re still alive, so by necessity…"
[Action: Itadori and Ijichi leave the room.],
Itadori,Makes sense. Let’s go!
[Action: Ijichi comes back to the room.],
Ijichi,"You already know the location of the culprit, don’t you? And not just “to some extent”."
Nanami,"Of course. If the culprit had wanted, he could have left the scene without leaving any residuals.

We’re being lured in once again."
Ijichi,Ngh…
Nanami,"Weighing the risk of storming in alone against the risk of taking Itadori-kun with me, I simply chose the former. He’s still a child, after all."
[Action: Itadori pushes Ijichi from behind.],
Itadori,Nanami-sensei!
Ijichi,"Woah! Ugh!

Itadori-kun?"
Itadori,"I forgot to say something. Be careful, okay?"
Ijichi,Heh…
Nanami,"Itadori-kun… I’m not a teacher, so please don’t call me “Sensei”."
Itadori,"Nanamin, then!"
Nanami,I will slap you.
,
[Scene: The next day. Itadori and Ijichi trail Yoshino in a car.],
Ijichi,There he is.
Itadori,Huh? Casual clothes?
Ijichi,"It looks like he hasn’t attended school for some time.

We’ll get out of the car here.

Let’s go."
[Action: Itadori and Ijichi trail Yoshino on foot through the city. Itadori holds a cage with small curses in it.],
Curses,Grr… Grrr…
"[Scene: In the past, at Satozakura High School. Yoshino runs the movie club and talks with two other boys.]",
Boy,What? The “Super Scary Movie” series went up to 5?
Yoshino,"Up to 7, actually"
Boy,For real? The seventh one must be really out there.
Yoshino,It became a completely different thing by 7. It’s not even a parody movie anymore.
Boy,Then what kind of movie is it?
Yoshino,"Hmm… Convoluted sitcom plus lineage horror, I suppose?"
Boy,What the heck?
Yoshino,"By a total fluke, the grandchild of the main character from 1 ends up living in a shared house with the grandchild of the culprit from 2 and the grandchild of the first person who died in 3, but it turns out it’s a haunted house, so they call in a spirit medium. That’s the story."
Boy,Woah… Sounds boring.
Yoshino,It bored me to death.
Boy,Who’d watch something like that?
Yoshino,"What’s interesting, though, is that the guy from 5 and 6 --"
[Action: The door opens suddenly.],
Yoshino,Ah…
Bullies,"Huh? What are you doing here?

Didn’t I tell you not to use this room because we’re making it our club room now?"
Yoshino,"B-But you haven’t been using it lately, so I thought it was fine now…"
[Action: Itou throws DVDs on the floor and stomps on them.],
"Yoshino, Boys",Ngh!
Itou,So?
Yoshino,"So, well, um…"
[Action: One of the bullies kicks the table.],
Yoshino,Ah!
Bully,"Just get out of here already, you cockroaches!"
Boy,"L-Let’s go, Yoshino."
Yoshino,Ngh…
Bully,"Next time you use it, we’ll send you flying!"
[Action: Yoshino and the other two boys begin to leave.],
Bully,"Oh, score!"
[Action: Yoshino pauses.],
Boy,"Hey, what are you doing?!"
Yoshino,Ngh… Grr…
Itou,What?
Yoshino,I’m taking it home…
Itou,Huh?
[Action: Yoshino grabs the smashed DVD.],
Yoshino,… so move your foot.
Boy,"Hey, stop it!"
Yoshino,"I’m taking this home, so could you move your foot?"
Boy,Oh… Ahh…
[Action: The bully kicks Yoshino away.],
Yoshino,Ngh!
Boys,Ah!
Yoshino,Ngh… Ugh…
Boys,Shit!
[Action: The other two boys run off. Itou pats Yoshino on the shoulder.],
Itou,Close the door.
Bully,Roger.
[Action: One of the bullies closes the door.],
Itou,Fufu…
Yoshino,"Ugh… Ngh… Urgh…

Ah!"
[Action: The bullies begin beating Yoshino.],
Bullies,"Ngh! Urgh!

Fufufufu…

Ngh!

Come on, stand up!"
Yoshino,Ngh…
Bullies,"Hahahaha!

Urah!

Hahahaha!"

"[Scene: In the present, in Mahito’s hideout. Yoshino and Mahito talk.]",
Yoshino,"I wonder if the first person to say “the opposite of fondness is indifference” went to hell like they should have.

It’s just not possible that interacting maliciously with others could be more proper than leaving them alone.

“The opposite of fondness is hate.” Japanese people love that. They like to gloat over complicating a simple answer."
Mahito,The man who coined that phrase wasn’t Japanese.
Yoshino,I’m talking about the mistaken translation.
Mahito,Hm?
Yoshino,"The original phrase, spoken by some foreigner, was “the opposite of love is indifference”, right?

There are various definitions of “love”, so “indifference” works as an antonym there."
Mahito,That’s true.
Yoshino,"But we generally don’t use “love” very much, right? That’s why, in this country, it got changed to “fondness” at some point. That version spread without any thought as to whether the opposing definitions of “love” and “indifference” still held true."
Mahito,"Everyone likes a little wordplay. After all, humans can’t live without making up excuses."
[Action: Mahito guides Yoshino to a former human that has been transformed into a large blob.],
Yoshino,What’s this?
Mahito,"An experiment to see just how large I can make a single human.

On that one, I tried to see how small I could make one."
[Action: Yoshino looks at a small transformed human in his hand.],
Yoshino,Ah… This is… a human?
Mahito,"Are you used to corpses, Junpei?"
Yoshino,"I don’t know.

If this was my mother, I might lose control and end up hating you.

But I already know how repulsive humans can be.

That’s why I don’t expect anything from other people, nor do I think much of it when someone I don’t know dies.

Indifference is the virtue people ought to strive for."
Mahito,"And despite that, you want revenge."
Yoshino,Are you trying to say that’s contradictory?
Mahito,Do you believe people have hearts?
Yoshino,Huh? Do they not?
Mahito,"They don’t.

They have souls, but souls aren’t hearts."
Yoshino,Then what about my…
Mahito,"I’m the only person in this world who understands the composition of souls.

After all, I change the shape of other creatures by making contact with them. All emotions are the result of the soul’s metabolism. They’re far too mechanical to call hearts.

People place too much value on things they can’t see. I can see them, and souls are no more special than physical bodies.

They’re just there. Do you get it? There’s no value or importance to life. Life just continues its cycle, same as the waters of the world.

That’s true for both you and me.

Our lives are meaningless and have no value."
Curse,Li…
Mahito,"And that’s why we can do anything we want. We’re free to live our lives however we please.

You can’t let yourself get trapped in an ideal of indifference. There’s no need for consistency in how you live your life. Just as you eat when you get hungry, you can kill someone if you hate them.

I’ll sanction you fully."
[Action: Mahito crushes the smaller transformed human in his hand.],
Yoshino,Ahh…
,
[Scene: In the town. Yoshino flexes his hand.],
Yoshino,Heh…
[Action: Itadori and Ijichi follow Yoshino in a car.],
Ijichi,There he is.
Itadori,Huh? Casual clothes?
Ijichi,It looks like he hasn’t attended school for some time.
Yoshino,"The same could be said for me, though. So, are the others doing well?"
[Scene: On the track field. Panda spins Kugisaki around.],
Kugisaki,Gahhh!
Panda,Urahhh!
Inumaki,"Tuna, tuna!"
[Scene: In the car. Ijichi smiles wistfully.],
Ijichi,I hear they’re doing quite well.
Itadori,Mm… So what do we do?
[Action: Ijichi looks toward a cage with two curses.],
Ijichi,We use that.
Itadori,Huh? Is that a cursed spirit?
Curse,Urr…
Ijichi,"It’s a fly head, a low-level curse that doesn’t even qualify as grade 4."
Curse,Grr… Grrr…
Ijichi,"Once we reach a place with no people, we’ll have it attack him."
Itadori,Huh?
Ijichi,"One: if he’s a normal person who can’t perceive curses, please save him.

Two: if he can perceive it but has no means to deal with it, likewise, please save him. Then we’ll question him about the day of the incident.

Three: if he exorcizes the fly head with jujutsu… we immediately restrain him."
Itadori,By force?
Ijichi,"By force. If it’s a misunderstanding, that’s fine. We’ll apologize after the fact. However… Four: if Yoshino Junpei possesses potential equal to or greater than a grade 2 sorcerer, we retreat and meet back up with Nanami-san."
Itadori,I think I can just barely handle a grade 2.
Ijichi,"If this were a cursed spirit, yes."
Itadori,Huh?
Ijichi,"Fushiguro-kun mentioned it before, remember? Typically, cursed spirits are assigned to sorcerers of equal grade. That means a grade 2 sorcerer would be expected to beat grade 2 cursed spirits, so a grade 2 sorcerer possesses strength close to a grade 1 cursed spirit."
Itadori,Why wasn’t I ever told something that important?
Ijichi,"(Thoughts) Because Gojou-san’s so irresponsible…

Haa…

We’ll get out of the car here."
[Action: Itadori and Ijichi get out of the car.],
Itadori,"This feels like I’m doing all the work, and I’m really not into it."
,
[Scene: In the sewer. Nanami stands among the bodies of several curses.],
Nanami,"If you plan to come out, please hurry up and do so.

They may be disfigured and beyond saving, but murdering people makes me sick."
[Action: Mahito emerges from the shadows.],
Mahito,"Ah, what a relief.

I’d be in trouble if Gojou Satoru were here… but it’s not much of an experiment if you’re too weak."
Nanami,"I hate overtime, so let’s just finish this quickly."
,
,
,
[Scene: In the sewer. Nanami charges at Mahito.],
Gojou,(Imagination) Hahahaha! Hahahaha! I’ll murder you!
Mahito,Fufu!
Nanami,(Thoughts) They’re similar.
[Action: Nanami strikes at Mahito.],
Nanami,(Thoughts) That picture-perfect frivolity…
Mahito,Ngh…
Nanami,(Thoughts) … and the sinister strength behind it.
Mahito,"Ngh!

Heh…

Ngh…"
[Action: Nanami kicks Mahito back. Measurements appear on Mahito’s arms. Mahito puts his arms up to shield himself.],
Mahito,Heh…
Nanami,Ngh!
"[Action: Nanami strikes Mahito’s arm, cutting his wrist with his wrapped weapon.]",
Mahito,"Huh?

Hm? I did block it, didn’t it? With cursed energy.

Is it that kind of technique?"
Nanami,What do you mean “that kind”? I hate abstract questions that leave interpretation up to others.
Mahito,"That’s good. So you don’t hate chatting, then."
Nanami,"It depends on the person.

(Thoughts) This cursed spirit is capable of conversing quite well, just like the two unregistered special-grades in Gojou-san’s report. I suppose it would be unnatural for them to be unrelated."
Mahito,"Hey, tell me. Which do you think came first, the soul or the body?"
Nanami,Hm?
Mahito,"Come on, you know. It’s like the question of whether the chicken or the egg came first.

Do you think the soul resides in the body? Or do you think the body forms around the soul?"
Nanami,"(Thoughts) I have to listen, I guess…

The former."
Mahito,Bzzt! The answer is the latter.
[Action: Mahito repairs his wrist.],
Mahito,"The soul always exists before the body.

The shape of the body is pulled along by the shape of the soul.

I’m not healing. I’m just strongly maintaining the shape of my own soul."
[Action: Mahito makes a transformed human in his hand.],
Mahito,"You understand now, don’t you? My technique is to make contact with the soul and alter its shape.

Idle Transfiguration."
Nanami,Hm?
Mahito,"I keep a stockpile of humans. It’s rather difficult, though.

Normal people eventually die when their shape is transfigured… but what about jujutsu sorcerers?"
[Action: Nanami looks at his watch.],
Nanami,"It’s 5:30 PM. I started work at 10 AM today, so I’m getting off at 6 PM, no matter what it takes."
,
[Scene: In a residential area. Yoshino walks by himself. Sotomura calls to him from the ground.],
Sotomura,Yoshino.
Yoshino,Ah…
Sotomura,"Where were you?

Mm… You know you shouldn’t be skipping school. Phew…"
Yoshino,Sotomura-sensei…
Sotomura,"Did you hear? Apparently Sayama, Nishimura, and Honda are dead. You were friends with them, weren’t you?"
Yoshino,Wha?
Bullies,(Flashback) Hah! Ngh!
Sotomura,"They spent a lot of time with you when you had no other friends, right? Yet you didn’t even attend their funerals…

Honestly, what’s wrong with you?"
Yoshino,"(Thoughts) Friends? Me… and them?

(Thoughts) He’s insane.

(Thoughts) You teachers… You graduate from school and then go work in schools, so you don’t actually experience the real world, do you? That’s how we end up with overgrown children like you, isn’t it?"
Bully,"(Flashback) Here, say “ahh”."
Yoshino,(Thoughts) Every last one of them!
Bully,(Flashback) Look over here.
Mahito,(Flashback) I’ll sanction you fully.
Yoshino,Ah!
Sotomura,What are you mumbling about? Did you lose your mind from self-isolation? Just kidding. Hahahaha!
Yoshino,Grr… Ngh…
[Action: Yoshino puts his fingers to his temple.],
Itadori,Stop!
Yoshino,Ah…
[Action: Itadori jumps at Yoshino with the fly head curse.],
Sotomura,Huh?
Curse,Grr!
Itadori,"(Thoughts) Oh, this guy… can see it."
[Action: Itadori lands on his feet but hits his head on a pole.],
Itadori,"Oww! Ugh!

Ngh… Damn, that hurt!"
[Scene: Five seconds ago. Itadori and Ijichi watch Yoshino from behind a pole.],
Ijichi,"(Flashback) Here we go, Itadori-kun!"
Itadori,(Flashback) Time out! There’s someone there!
"[Action: Ijichi opens the cage, releasing the two curses.]",
Ijichi,(Flashback) Huh?
Itadori,"(Flashback) Oh, no!"
[Scene: In the present. Itadori holds his head in pain.],
Itadori,Thank goodness…
Sotomura,What? You a gymnast or something?
[Action: Itadori gets in Yoshino’s space.],
Yoshino,Ah…
Itadori,"Hey, I have some things I want to ask you about. Would you come with me?"
Yoshino,Huh? Ah… Ah…
[Action: Yoshino looks at the button on Itadori’s uniform.],
Itadori,Come on.
Yoshino,(Thoughts) That button…
Sotomura,Hold on. He and I were just talking. You’re rude!
Itadori,"Ah… Uh, well, it’s a rather important matter."
Sotomura,An important matter? You’re just a kid! What’s so important? And what uniform is that --
[Action: Itadori pulls down Sotomura’s pants.],
Itadori,Plop!
Yoshino,Wh-Wha…
Sotomura,"Ah!

What are you doing, you brat?! Stop! Stop this!"
[Action: Itadori runs off with Sotomura’s pants.],
Sotomura,"Don’t run off with them!

W-Wait!"
[Action: Sotomura runs after Itadori.],
Yoshino,What was that about?
[Action: Itadori appears behind Yoshino.],
Yoshino,Ah…
Itadori,"Okay, now, let’s go!"
Yoshino,Huh?! That was fast! You already ran that entire lap?
Itadori,Yeah.
Yoshino,You didn’t have to go through all that… You could’ve just dragged me away.
Itadori,"Well, sure. But you hate that guy, don’t you?"
Yoshino,Huh? How do you…
Itadori,"Hm? Just a hunch. Oh, was I wrong?"
Yoshino,You’re not wrong.
Itadori,"You don’t want someone you hate loitering in front of your home forever, right? Let’s head over there for now."
Yoshino,Ahh… Sure.
,
[Scene: In the sewer. Nanami continues to fight Mahito.],
Nanami,Ngh!
Mahito,"Your mobility is impressive.

Heh!"
Nanami,Ngh…
Mahito,"Mm~!

(Thoughts) This is so fun."
Nanami,"(Thoughts) So the person’s original mass is irrelevant when it comes to changing their shape?

(Thoughts) Either way, it’s a bad match-up for my technique."
[Action: A transformed human cries and pleads with Nanami from the ground.],
Curse,… elp…
Nanami,Ah…
Curse,Help… me…
Ieiri,"(Flashback) You can’t save anyone once they’ve been reshaped. If they attack, kill them without hesitation. That’s better for the victims, too."
Mahito,"Oh, sorry.

I’ve practiced a lot, so they don’t die right away when I change their size, but their… brains? Awareness? I still lack precision with that, so sometimes their souls sweat like that. Don’t worry about it. Let’s continue."
Nanami,I’m not worried about it.
[Action: Nanami wipes the transformed human’s tear away.],
Nanami,It’s my policy not to bring personal feelings into work.
Mahito,"Haha! You suck at lying! Your soul is trembling.

So you’re… what grade?"
Nanami,Grade 1.
Mahito,"No wonder you’re strong.

You’ll make the best test subject. Luck’s really on my side."
[Action: Mahito launches forward and puts his hand on Nanami’s stomach.],
Mahito,I’m grateful.
Nanami,Ngh… Ugh!
[Action: Nanami swings at Mahito. Mahito jumps away.],
Mahito,"Surprised my speed suddenly increased? I can alter the shape of my own soul, too.

Jujutsu sorcerers can protect their bodies with cursed energy, but they aren’t protecting their souls. For starters, you have to be aware of your own soul. It’s not possible to protect yourself if you can’t do that.

But it looks like you subconsciously covered your soul somewhat with cursed energy. IF you hadn’t, you’d already be under my control.

Although once I touch you two or three more times, you’ll cease to be human."
Nanami,Ngh…
Mahito,Heh…
Nanami,Ngh…
[Action: Nanami runs forward. He and Mahito are locked in conflict.],
Mahito,"Ngh…

Heh… I’m not letting you go!"
[Action: Nanami runs toward the end of the sewer.],
Mahito,Ngh!
[Action: Mahito tries to touch Nanami. Nanami blocks it with his knife.],
Mahito,"Was that it, grade 1 sorcerer? You did well running around, but you’re at your limit, aren’t you?"
[Action: Nanami’s watch strikes 6 PM. Nanami puts his knife away and undoes his tie.],
Nanami,"Haa…

Unfortunately…"
[Action: Nanami’s hand fills with cursed energy.],
Mahito,"(Thoughts) What?

(Thoughts) His cursed energy’s increasing?"
Nanami,… I’m going into overtime now.
[Scene: In the sewer. Nanami faces off against Mahito.],
Mahito,"Was that it, grade 1 sorcerer? You did well running around, but you’re at your limit, aren’t you?"
[Action: Nanami’s watch hits 6 PM. Nanami loosens his tie and puts his knife away.],
Nanami,"Haa…

Unfortunately…"
[Action: Cursed energy surrounds Nanami’s hand.],
Mahito,"(Thoughts) What?

(Thoughts) His cursed energy’s increasing?"
[Action: Nanami ties his tie around his hand. Cursed energy surrounds his body.],
Nanami,… I’m going into overtime now.
Mahito,"(Thoughts) Overtime?

(Thoughts) A time-based pact! He was limiting his own cursed energy this whole time?

How interesting!

Mm…"
Nanami,"My cursed technique draws a line along the target and, using a ratio of 7:3, creates a weak point at that location.

I can create this line along more than just their full height or wingspan. I can designate it along various parts, such as the head, upper arm, forearm, and so on.

This cursed technique can affect more than just living creatures, as well."
Mahito,"(Thoughts) He’s revealing his technique?

You’re serious, huh?"
[Action: Nanami launches forward.],
Nanami,"(Thoughts) At present, the first way I can see to exorcize this cursed spirit.

(Thoughts) It’s to continue damaging him until he runs out of cursed energy. However, that’s not very realistic for me.

(Thoughts) The second way is to reduce him to smithereens with a single blow.

Ratio Technique: Collapse!"
[Action: Nanami punches a wall.],
Mahito,"(Thoughts) What power! No, more importantly, cursed energy raced through it? No way!

(Thoughts) It’s an expanded technique that imbues the destroyed target with cursed energy! It’s a wide-range attack that puts him at risk, too. So I guess…

… I should dodge this one."
[Action: Nanami cuts through Mahito’s leg.],
Nanami,I’m retreating for now.
Mahito,Ah…
Nanami,"You should get that leg healed quickly.

If we both manage to survive, let’s meet again."
[Action: Nanami walks off.],
Mahito,Ahh… Huh?
[Action: The rubble from the wall falls on Mahito.],

"[Scene: In the evening, near a river. Itadori and Yoshino hang out.]",
Itadori,Huh? Did the ground just shake?
Yoshino,"Yeah, it did. Intensity 2 or so?"
[Action: Itadori tries to call Ijichi with no luck.],
Curse,Urr… Urah!
Itadori,"Ugh! Nope, Ijichi-san’s not answering.

Should I really be the one to ask this?"
Yoshino,Hm?
Itadori,"(Thoughts) Is it really okay to just ask him straight-up about that, though? How much am I allowed to reveal about Jujutsu Tech, anyway?

Ah…"
Phone,The number you have dialed cannot be reached at this time.
Itadori,Just answer!
[Scene: Elsewhere in the town. Ijichi struggles to catch the other curse.],
Curse,Urahh…
Ijichi,Hmph!
Curse,Urahh…
Ijichi,Ahh! Wait!
[Scene: Near the river. Itadori ponders.],
Itadori,I wonder what’s going on…
Yoshino,(Flashback) A button with a swirl?
Mahito,"(Flashback) Yep. If you meet a student wearing this button with a swirl, you should be friendly to them.

(Flashback) They’re just jujutsu sorcerers. I’m sure you’ll get along with them."
Yoshino,"(Thoughts) But the jujutsu sorcerers are Mahito-san’s enemies, right?"
Itadori,Ugh!
Yoshino,Ah…
Itadori,"Forget it! I’m just going to ask!

Listen, there were people who died at the theater you went to the other day."
Yoshino,Ah…
Itadori,"Did you happen to see anything? A creepy thing like this, maybe?"
Curse,Urr…
Yoshino,"No, I didn’t. I’ve only recently started seeing those clearly."
Itadori,"I see. Well, I’ve got nothing else to ask, then!"
Yoshino,Huh? That’s it?
Itadori,But could you still wait until my… I guess he’s like my boss… shows up?
Yoshino,"Yeah, sure."
Itadori,Thanks!
[Action: Itadori sits next to Yoshino.],
Yoshino,Mm…
Itadori,Hey. What were you watching at the theater?
Yoshino,It was a repeat screening of an old movie. I doubt you’d know it if I told you.
Itadori,"Come on, just tell me."
Yoshino,“Human Earthworm 3”.
Itadori,That one was super boring! I got hit so many times over that.
Yoshino,"You got hit?

Honestly, it was. But it’s just a splatter film, so maybe it’s our own fault for asking it to deliver more than that. But 2 was --"
Itadori,"But 2 was pretty good, right?"
Yoshino,"Ah… Yeah! Yeah, it was! It was the only one with a way you could enjoy it!"
[Action: Kenjaku watches Itadori and Yoshino from a walkway above.],
Itadori,Huh? A way to enjoy it?
Kenjaku,Bingo.
Yoshino,Have you seen the entire series?
[Action: Kenjaku walks off.],
Yoshino,"At first, 2 looks like it wouldn’t be any different from 1 or 3, but it actually captures the changing emotions of the perfectionist who abandons everything."
Woman,“Ah!”
Man,“Mama…”
Woman,“Ngh…!”
Itadori,"Oh, so that’s why I was able to watch 2."
Man,“Why?”
Yoshino,"At first, I couldn’t understand what was so good about it, so I made myself watch it three times. It had the most effective gory scenes, too, so it wasn’t easy to rewatch. Phew…"
Itadori,Why’d you go that far?
Yoshino,"Do you like movies, Itadori-kun?"
Itadori,"I’ve been watching a lot of them lately, for certain reasons. Though I haven’t been seeing them in theaters."
Yoshino,"What? But the emotional impact of finding a good one at the theater is huge, even if on-demand is more convenient."
Itadori,"When was the last time I saw one in a theater?

Take me with you next time there’s one you’re into."
Yoshino,Huh?! Ah… Erk…
Itadori,"Oh, need my contact info?

Here."
[Action: Itadori holds out his phone.],
Itadori,How do I add friends again?
Nagi,"Oh, Junpei?"
Yoshino,Ah… Mom.
Nagi,It’s unusual to see you out here. Is this a friend?
Yoshino,"We just met, actually."
Itadori,"We may have just met, but I think we can be friends!"
Nagi,"Really? I hope you get along well, then!"
Yoshino,Mom!
Nagi,Ah…
Yoshino,I asked you… to quit smoking…
Nagi,"Oh, right, sorry. I did promise not to smoke in front of you anymore."
[Action: Nagi walks down toward Itadori and Yoshino.],
Nagi,What’s your friend’s name?
Itadori,Itadori Yuuji! The green onion doesn’t suit your look!
Nagi,"Oh, you can tell? I’m trying to be a woman who doesn’t look good with green onions."
Yoshino,What are you even talking about?
Nagi,"So, Yuuji-kun, care to join us for dinner?"
Yoshino,H-Hey! You’re just bothering him!
Nagi,Huh? Are you saying my cooking is a nuisance?
"Yoshino, Nagi",Oh…
[Action: Itadori’s stomach growls loudly.],
Nagi,Anything you don’t like? Any allergies?
Itadori,Nope!
,
[Scene: At Mahito’s hideout. Kenjaku arrives and whistles after seeing the rubble. Something moves underneath it.],
Kenjaku,Oh?
[Action: Mahito crawls out from under the rubble.],
Mahito,Fufufu… Hahaha! That sorcerer’s more reckless than he looks! Hahahaha!
Kenjaku,You two went at it quite hard.
Mahito,"Oh, Getou! That guy was interesting. I learned a lot from him."
Kenjaku,Oh?
Mahito,"Even if I’m pulverized, I won’t die as long as I maintain the shape of my soul. Consumption of cursed energy counts toward supplementation of the self.

Also, it looks like there’s no risk to me, no matter how much I tweak the shape of my own soul."
[Action: Mahito turns his finger into a blade.],
Mahito,"Next time, I’ll let loose and try all kinds of things.

Getou, get me some clothes."
Kenjaku,Nope. What happened to the guy you fought?
Mahito,"I don’t know. He said he was retreating, but he might be buried under the rubble."
,
[Scene: In the town. Ijichi contacts Itadori by phone.],
Ijichi,What?! You’re at Yoshino Junpei’s home?! That’s a bit of a…
Itadori,"Oh, it’s fine. Well, I’m about to have dinner."
Ijichi,"Dinner?!

I’ll head there at once. If you sense anything odd, please run immediately."
[Action: Ijichi hangs up the phone.],
Ijichi,"(Thoughts) Even if Yoshino Junpei is involved in this incident as a perpetrator, I doubt he could quickly kill Itadori-kun as he is now.

(Thoughts) But still, this is a huge blunder on my part as his supervisor! As blithe as Gojou-san is, he might not mind, but if the adult-of-adults, Nanami-san, chews me out… I’ll probably cry!

Hurry up now! You don’t want to cry in front of others at your age, do you?!"
[Action: Nanami calls Ijichi on the phone.],
Ijichi,"Ngh…

Ahh! He’s calling me earlier than scheduled! Yeah, he’s going to chew me out!"
[Action: Ijichi answers the phone.],
Ijichi,"Hello, I’m sorry."
Nanami,"Huh?

I just sent you my location data. Please come and pick me up. I’m going back to Jujutsu Tech to receive treatment from Ieiri-san."
Ijichi,Erk… Treatment?
Nanami,Don’t worry. It’s not an injury that’ll kill me.
Ijichi,"That’s good. I’ll join up with Itadori-kun soon, then I’ll head your way."
Nanami,He’s not with you?
Ijichi,(Thoughts) Ugh… I’m such an idiot!
[Action: Nanami hangs up the phone and leans against the wall.],
Nanami,Phew…
Mahito,(Flashback) I’ve practiced a lot. You’ll make the best test subject. Luck’s really on my side.
Nanami,"(Thoughts) That cursed spirit is a child.

(Thoughts) It probably hasn’t been very long since he sprang into being. He’s greedily enjoying his own growth.

(Thoughts) The special-grade cursed spirits that Gojou-san fought had mastered domain expansion. If he managed to survive, it won’t be much longer before he reaches that stage, too.

(Thoughts) On top of that, his victim count far exceeded our expectations."
Curse,(Flashback) Help me…
Nanami,"(Thoughts) We need to exorcize him as soon as possible, before it’s too late."
,
"[Scene: At Yoshino’s house. Itadori, Yoshino, and Nagi sit down for dinner.]",
"Itadori, Nagi",Hahahaha! Hahahaha!
Nagi,And then?
Itadori,"So then Takashi-kun says, full of confidence…"
Y.Takashi,(Flashback) This is the larva of an invasive species! It might be poisonous! Nobody touch it!
Itadori,"… and then I tried picking it up, and it turned out to be a konjac noodle from lunch!"
Nagi,"Hahahaha! Wait, konjac? It was a konjac noodle?! Hahahaha!"
Yoshino,"Mom, you’ve had too much to drink."
Nagi,"You’re funny, Yuuji-kun! Here, do something funny with these!"
Yoshino,(Thoughts) She’s the worst kind of drunk.
[Action: Itadori takes a plate and leek from Nagi.],
Itadori,Wilson! Wilson!
[Action: Yoshino spits out his drink.],
Itadori,"Forgive me, Wilson!"
Yoshino,"That’s from “Castaway”, isn’t it?"
Itadori,You got it!
Nagi,I don’t get it. Is that a movie reference?
Itadori,Fire!
"Itadori, Yoshino",Hahahaha! Hahahaha!
,
[Scene: Sometime later. Nagi sleeps with her head on the table. Yoshino puts a sheet over her shoulders.],
Itadori,Your mom’s really nice.
Yoshino,Yeah.
[Scene: In the past. Yoshino tells Nagi about not wanting to go to school.,
Nagi,"(Flashback) School?

(Flashback) It’s okay. You don’t have to go."
Yoshino,(Flashback) Huh?
Nagi,"(Flashback) Kids your age tend to take things too seriously. School is just a tiny aquarium.

(Flashback) There’s a whole ocean out there, and other aquariums, too. Pick the one you want.

(Flashback) Hey, that was a really cool thing to say, wasn’t it?"
Yoshino,(Flashback) Ah…
Nagi,"(Flashback) What a brilliant saying. Way to go, me!"
Yoshino,(Flashback) Heh…
[Scene: In the present. Yoshino chats with Itadori.],
Yoshino,What’s your mom like?
Itadori,"Uh, I’ve never met her. Though I have a few faint memories of my father… But my grandpa was there for me."
Yoshino,Ah…
[Action: Itadori’s phone rings.],
Itadori,"Oh, sorry. Got a call."
[Action: Itadori answers the phone.],
Itadori,"Hello, Ijichi-san?

Yeah, I’m fine.

But we’re about to watch a movie.

Okay. Two hours from now, then."
Ijichi,Two hours?!
[Action: Itadori hangs up the phone.],
Yoshino,"You’re a jujutsu sorcerer, right?"
Itadori,"Yeah.

(Thoughts) Should I have said that?"
Yoshino,Have you… ever killed someone?
Itadori,"Hm?

No."
Yoshino,"But someday you’ll have to fight bad jujutsu sorcerers, right? What will you do then?"
Itadori,I still wouldn’t want to kill them.
Yoshino,Why not? They’re bad people.
Itadori,"It’s like… I just think if I killed anyone, the option of killing would force its way into my life.

The value of life would become ambiguous… I wouldn’t even understand the importance of those I care about anymore… and that scares me."
Yoshino,Ngh…
,
"[Scene: Sometime later, after Itadori has left. Yoshino lies in bed.]",
Yoshino,(Thoughts) People don’t have hearts. That idea saved me. It gave me strength. But if killing someone would mean tainting my soul… then I can’t kill anyone.
[Action: Nagi stirs in the kitchen.],
Nagi,"Ngh… Mmm… Ahh~… Darn, I fell asleep. Did Yuuji-kun go home already? Gah! It’s already this late?! I need to clean up.

Ah… Huh? What’s this?"
[Action: A curse appears behind Nagi.],
Nagi,A finger?
,
,
,
Ijichi,"After the incident at Satozakura High School, we discovered the corpse of Yoshino Nagi, Yoshino Junpei’s mother, at their home, along with an unsealed Sukuna’s finger, his second left arm’s pinky finger.

We believe Yoshino Nagi was attacked by cursed spirits drawn to Sukuna’s finger. Her remains are missing everything from the waist down.

There were no visible or detectable traces of blood found on-site, and Yoshino Nagi’s body was lying down in her bedroom. Lifting up the blanket revealed only gold packs and ice bags spread out beneath it."
[Scene: In a hallway. Itadori and Nanami wait.],
Itadori,"Are you saying I’d get in the way, Nanamin?

You’re injured, aren’t you? Next time, take me with you.

“My partner died. But I wasn’t there at the time. Why? Because I’m a child.”"
Wasuke,"(Flashback) You’re a strong kid, so help others."
Itadori,I don’t want any of that.
Nanami,You can’t.
Itadori,Ngh…
Nanami,"As you already know, this patchwork cursed spirit uses transfigured people.

There are some people who are beyond saving.

If you continue this work, there will come a time when you’re forced to kill a person yourself."
Itadori,Ah…
Nanami,But this is not that time.
Itadori,(Flashback) I still wouldn’t want to kill them. And that scares me.
Nanami,"Please understand this. Being a child is not a sin.

I would like to ask you to continue monitoring Yoshino Junpei."
[Action: Nanami walks off.],
,
[Scene: At Yoshino’s house. Yoshino puts on his mother’s black jacket.],
Yoshino,"(Thoughts) I didn’t own any black clothing, so I opened my mom’s closet and put on the first thing that caught my eye."
[Action: Yoshino exits the house.],
Yoshino,"(Thoughts) The smell of the morning air and the commute to school were all familiar, but today…"
"[Scene: In the past, after Nagi is killed. Mahito tells Yoshino about Sukuna’s fingers.]",
Mahito,(Flashback) This is a cursed object known as “Sukuna” that attracts other curses.
Yoshino,(Flashback) What was a thing like that doing in my home?
Mahito,"(Flashback) There are many curse users who earn money by cursing people. It was probably done by one of them.

(Flashback) With money and connections, it’s easy to curse someone to death. Can you think of anyone?"
Yoshino,(Flashback) Ngh…
Mahito,"(Flashback) Anyone who might hold a grudge against you or your mother?

(Flashback) Or perhaps… someone dark and gloomy, with plenty of money and free time?"
[Scene: At Sotozakura High School. Yoshino stands outside as an assembly is being held.],
Teacher,The certificate of commendation and the prize for the finest work in the national book report competition goes to Itou Shouta.
[Action: Itou accepts a certificate.],
Girls,"One, two…"
Itou,Hm?
Girls,"Shouta-senpai!

Ahh~!"
Itou,"Gosh, they’re embarrassing me."
Boy,Ngh…
Teacher,We are extremely pleased to have…
[Action: Itou taps the boy’s hand with his certificate.],
Boy,Ngh!
Itou,"What the hell were you thinking? I told you to just write whatever, but you made me with top damn prize. You want to die?"
Boy,I-I’m sorry…
Itou,Yet you only landed a participation prize.
Boy,Haa… Shouta-senpai really is cool.
Girls,"Right?

That so? Well, I’ll give him props for being rich.

Hm?"
[Action: A veil begins to appear over the school.],
Girl,What’s that black stuff?
Boy,Huh? Where?
Mahito,"Emerge from darkness, blacker than darkness. Purify that which is impure."
[Action: The veil appears over the school.],
Mahito,"Hey, I did it."
Kenjaku,"Thanks, Mahito. I can’t afford to leave any residuals of me behind.

What are the veil’s effects?"
Mahito,"They cannot escape from inside. Some can enter from outside, but only those with weak cursed energy."
Kenjaku,"It’s an unannounced veil in a residential area. The windows will report it right away.

I hope this plays out as you believe it will."
Mahito,"I think it’ll go fine.

The general course was already set once Junpei landed Sukuna’s vessel. I’ll cause the two of them to clash and force Itadori Yuuji into a pact giving Sukuna dominance."
Kenjaku,I sure wish Jougo was as level-headed as you.
Mahito,"But it’s cute how honest and straightforward he is. Anyway, you okay with this? That finger was a precious resource, right?"
Kenjaku,"It’s fine. The finger from the juvenile center was quickly absorbed into Itadori Yuuji, after all. I’d like to have Jujutsu Tech retrieve the one we placed at Yoshino Junpei’s home, as well."
Mahito,Oh? Another ploy?
Kenjaku,"Yeah. Well, I’ll be taking my leave."
Mahito,"Huh? You’re leaving? You should stay and watch, too. I’m sure it’ll be fun…"
[Action: Kenjaku leaves the area. Mahito watches the school.],
Mahito,… watching foolish kids die.
[Action: Sotomura finds most of the students passed out on the floor.],
Sotomura,H-Hey! What’s wrong with you guys?! Get a grip! Are you okay?!
Boy,Ugh…
Yoshino,They’re not dead.
Sotomura,"Huh?

Yoshino? Why…

 Wait, do you know what’s going on here?"
Yoshino,Sensei.
[Action: Yoshino shows off the cigarette burns on his forehead.],
Yoshino,Make sure you’re watching.
Sotomura,"You… Those scars…

That’s…"
Yoshino,"… what’s already happened, and what’s about to happen."
[Action: Yoshino walks toward Itou.],
Itou,Yoshino… Ngh…
Yoshino,I have a question for you. Are you the one who left that in my home?
Itou,"Huh? What are you –

Ah! Ugh…"
[Action: Purple marks begin appearing on Itou’s arm.],
Itou,Ahh… Wh-What is this? What did you do?! Ngh!
Yoshino,That’s no good.
[Action: Yoshino punches Itou in the arm.],
Itou,Gah! Ugh…
Yoshino,Do you still think you’re in a position to answer questions with your own questions?
[Action: Yoshino kicks Itou.],
Itou,Ngh!
Yoshino,"You are going to die, whether your answer is yes or no.

After all, I don’t have a technique to see through your lies, and you’ve already done more than enough to earn it!"
[Action: Yoshino lifts Itou’s body into the air.],
Itou,Ugh…
Yoshino,"So show some sincerity in your final moments, at least."
Itou,I’m… sorry…
Yoshino,And?
Itou,Ngh…
Yoshino,Come on!
[Action: Itadori bursts through the gymnasium doors.],
Itadori,Ah…
Sotomura,Ngh…
Itadori,"What are you doing, Junpei?!"
Yoshino,"Stay out of this, jujutsu sorcerer."
[Scene: In a hallway. Itadori talks with Nanami on the phone.],
Itadori,"I’m going, Nanamin."
Nanami,"You can’t. I already explained why this morning.

If a veil has been cast, there’s a strong likelihood he’s both alive and at Satozakura High School."
Curses,Grr…
Nanami,"I’ll be back soon. Please wait there, Itadori-kun."
[Action: Itadori hangs up the phone.],
Nanami,(Thoughts) It’s probably pointless to ask him that.
"[Action: Nanami walks toward the exit of the sewers, leaving Ino to clean up.]",
Nanami,"You heard why, so I’ll leave the rest of this to you, Ino-kun."
Ino,Huh?!
Nanami,Is there a problem with that?
Ino,"Well, the number of them… There’s a lot. And they’re all humans, right?"
Nanami,I wouldn’t mind taking on the recommendation to make you a grade 1 jujutsu sorcerer.
Ino,"Erk… Heh… Let’s get this done, baby! Yeah!"
[Scene: In the hallway. Itadori prepares to leave. Ijichi blocks him.],
Itadori,"Please step aside, Ijichi-san."
Ijichi,"Our job is to help others. That includes those who are still students, like yourself.

I won’t make any more mistakes.

You must not go, Itadori-kun."
[Action: Itadori runs past Ijichi.],
Itadori,"(Thoughts) Sorry, Ijichi-san."
,
[Scene: At Satozakura High School. Itadori arrives.],
Itadori,"What are you doing, Junpei?!"
Yoshino,"Stay out of this, jujutsu sorcerer."
,
,
,
[Scene: At Satozakura High School. Itadori chases Yoshino while they fight.],
Itadori,Grr!
Yoshino,Moon Dregs!
Itadori,Ngh!
[Action: Itadori punches Yoshino’s shikigami.],
Itadori,(Thoughts) A jellyfish shikigami? Blunt attacks won’t work when he’s inside it?
Yoshino,"I’ll say it one more time. Stay out of this, jujutsu sorcerer!

It’s none of your business!"
Itadori,That’s not something you get to decide!
Yoshino,"What’s the point of indiscriminate salvation?

Don’t mistake the value of a life!"
[Action: Yoshino’s shikigami attacks Itadori.],
Itadori,Gah!
Yoshino,"People pretend their emotions are everything, but their heart is just the metabolism of the soul. It’s all a delusion! Don’t restrict me with rules that are based on a delusion.

No one has the right to stop anyone from taking what lives they can.

Just sleep over there. There’s something I have to go back and do."
[Action: Itadori grabs Yoshino’s collar.],
Yoshino,Ngh…
Mahito,"(Flashback) Your cursed technique is poison.

(Flashback) You produce poison from cursed energy and make your shikigami secrete it from its tentacles. You’ll learn to control the size and strength of your shikigami, as well as the potency of your poison.

(Flashback) A normal jujutsu sorcerer would need some time to grasp it, but I’ll teach you the sensation, so you’ll be able to fight right away.

(Flashback) Junpei, you have talent."
Yoshino,(Flashback) Ah… Ah…
Itadori,"Who are you making excuses for?

Grrr! Ngh… Guh…"
"[Action: Itadori moves to punch Yoshino, but Yoshino runs away with his shikigami.]",
Itadori,Ngh…
[Action: Yoshino continues to run while Itadori fights his shikigami.],
Itadori,"Urgh! Ugh! Ugh!

Urahh! Urah!"
"[Action: Itadori punches Yoshino’s shikigami, and it flies into Yoshino.]",
Yoshino,Ngh!
[Action: Yoshino and his shikigami fly out a window.],
Yoshino,(Thoughts) Why? Why won’t Moon Dregs’s poison work on him?
[Action: Yoshino bounces off his shikigami and onto a bike storage roof.],
Yoshino,"Ngh! Gah… Ugh…

Why are you getting in my way? Why? Why? Why?!

Ngh!

Ah…"
[Action: Itadori jumps down toward Yoshino.],
Yoshino,"(Thoughts) He’s in the air! He can’t move!

(Thoughts) No… If there’s a chance to crush him, it’s right before he lands!"
"[Action: Yoshino’s shikigami attacks Itadori, but he dodges.]",
Itadori,Ngh… Urah! Ngh… Urah!
[Action: Itadori punches Yoshino’s shikigami’s attack away.],
Yoshino,Ngh… Ugh…
Itadori,"Junpei, I don’t understand… a damn thing you’re saying!"
Yoshino,Grr… Ahh…
Itadori,You can string together whatever logic you want.
Gojou,"(Flashback) When facing shikigami users, strike the sorcerer directly."
Itadori,But you’re just trying…
[Action: Itadori charges at Yoshino.],
Yoshino,Ah…!
Itadori,… to convince yourself you’re in the right!
[Action: Itadori punches Yoshino back into the building.],
Yoshino,Ngh!
Itadori,"I don’t know what your motive is. I’m sure you have a reason for doing this.

But is it really worth throwing away that life you have?!"
[Action: Yoshino begins to sob.],
Yoshino,Mm… Ngh…
Itadori,The human heart is a delusion? Can you say that in front of her?!
Yoshino,People don’t have hearts…
Itadori,You’re still --
Yoshino,They don’t!
Itadori,Ah…
Yoshino,"Otherwise… Otherwise… that would mean people cursed me and my mom with those hearts!

That would just be too much… I wouldn’t know what is right or what is wrong anymore…"
"[Action: Yoshino summons his shikigami again and attacks Itadori, stabbing him through the chest and stomach.]",
Yoshino,Wha…
Itadori,Ngh…
Yoshino,Why didn’t you dodge it?
[Action: Yoshino releases his shikigami. Itadori begins walking over to him.],
Itadori,"Sorry… I said a lot of self-important stuff without understanding anything…

Tell me what happened.

I swear I won’t curse you anymore, so please…"
[Action: Yoshino explains Nagi’s death.],
Itadori,"No way… Your mom…

Junpei, come to Jujutsu Tech.

There are lots of crazy strong teachers and reliable friends there.

If we all work together, I’m sure we can find whoever cursed your mom. Then you can make sure they get their due!

Let’s fight together!"
[Action: Mahito stands at the top of the staircase.],
Itadori,Ah…
Mahito,Heh…
Itadori,Who are you?
Yoshino,Ah…
[Action: Mahito begins walking downstairs.],
Itadori,(Thoughts) Who is that? A person?
Mahito,Nice to meet you…
Itadori,"(Thoughts) No, this feels like…"
Mahito,… vessel of Sukuna.
[Action: Mahito's arm mutates.],
Yoshino,Wait!
Itadori,Wha…
Yoshino,Mahito-san!
[Action: Mahito pushes Itadori against the window with his arm.],
Itadori,"Ngh! Ugh…

(Thoughts) Am I an idiot?! A human-shaped cursed spirit with a patchwork face! This is exactly what Nanamin said would happen!

Junpei, run!"
Yoshino,Ah…
Itadori,"I don’t know what relationship you have with him, but right now, just run! Please!"
Yoshino,"Itadori-kun, please calm down! Mahito-san’s not a bad person… Ah…

Bad… person…"
[Action: Mahito puts his hand on Yoshino’s shoulder.],
Mahito,"You know, Junpei, you’ve got a good head on your shoulders."
Yoshino,Huh…?
Mahito,But sometimes deliberation can lead to worse foolishness than imprudence.
Itadori,Ngh… Grr…
Mahito,"You’re a stereotypical case of that!

You’re almost as foolish as those people you call fools yourself."
Yoshino,Ngh…
Mahito,"That’s why you’ll die. Fufu…

(Thoughts) Idle Transfiguration."
[Action: Mahito transfigures Yoshino into a curse.],
Yoshino,Ahh… Urahh…
[Action: Mahito lets Itadori go.],
Mahito,"Now, time for round two."
[Action: Yoshino charges at Itadori.],
Yoshino,Grr…
Itadori,Junpei…
[Action: Yoshino begins to beat Itadori.],
Yoshino,Ngh!
Itadori,Ngh…
Yoshino,Ngh!
Itadori,Junpei!
Yoshino,Ngh!
Itadori,Get a hold of yourself! I’ll heal you right now!
Yoshino,Grr… Grr… Grr…
Itadori,Sukuna… Sukuna!
[Action: Sukuna appears on Itadori’s face.],
Sukuna,What?
Mahito,Heh…
Itadori,I’ll do anything! You can do anything you want with me! So heal Junpei like you did when you restored my heart!
Sukuna,I refuse! Hehehehe!
Mahito,Hmm…
Itadori,Damn you…
Sukuna,"Hehe… Hahaha!

(Thoughts) Good. He’s completely forgotten about that pact.

How very amusing! You’d offer up your pride, your future, your everything, to try to rely on me…

And you can’t save anything."
Mahito,(Thoughts) He refused the pact? The shape of one’s soul isn’t something that reverse cursed techniques could deal with… Maybe healing others is beyond him?
Sukuna,"Pathetic! You couldn’t be more pathetic, brat! Hehehehe!"
Mahito,"(Thoughts) Though, what I’m after is what comes next, so I guess this is fine.

Fufu… Fufufufu…"
"Sukuna, Mahito",Hahahaha! Hahahaha! Hahahaha!
Itadori,"(Thoughts) Oh, that’s right. At the end of the day, these two are both curses."
[Action: Yoshino clutches at Itadori’s clothes.],
Yoshino,Yuuji… Why?
[Action: Yoshino falls to the ground and dies.],
Mahito,"Hahahaha! Hahahaha! Hahahaha! Oh, dead already? I suppose I was kind of rough when I changed his shape.

Phew… Guess that’s how it goes."
[Action: Itadori punches Mahito in the face. Mahito lands on the staircase.],
Mahito,"(Thoughts) That was an unusual blow. Interesting!

Too bad, though. That won’t work. So long as I maintain the shape of my --"
[Action: Blood spews from Mahito’s nose.],
Mahito,"Huh?

(Thoughts) Wha… What’s going on?

(Thoughts) He struck the shape of my soul, as well?

(Thoughts) That’s right! Itadori Yuuji’s a vessel! His body constantly houses another soul in addition to his own. So naturally…

You’re aware… of the outline of your soul?"
Itadori,"(Thoughts) The next words that spilled from my lips came from so deep within my gut that it nearly made all the things I’ve ever said feel like a lie.

I will kill you!"
,
,
,
[Scene: In Satozakura High School. Itadori prepares to fight Mahito.],
Mahito,"Heh… Don’t you mean you’ll “exorcize” me, jujutsu sorcerer?

(Thoughts) Itadori Yuuji isn’t concerned with his own life. Getou forbade me from forcing him into an external pact using hostages.

(Thoughts) So if he can’t kill a foe he hates so much that he longs to kill him, he’ll probably turn to Sukuna.

(Thoughts) If Junpei isn’t enough, I’d just need to transform every student one by one before his eyes.

(Thoughts) That would lead Itadori Yuuji to negotiate and forge a pact with Sukuna while he’s full of hatred for self-interest. If that also improved the chances of Sukuna joining our side, all the better.

(Thoughts) Though all of that presumes that I’m stronger than him, so why did he have to be my natural enemy?"
Itadori,Grrr… Urahhh! Urahh!
[Action: Itadori charges at Mahito and begins punching. Mahito dodges the attacks.],
Itadori,"Ngh! Urah!

Ngh! Urgh! Urahh! Urahhh! Urah! Urah!"
Mahito,Fufu…
Itadori,(Thoughts) He keeps changing his damn shape so much! Would it be better to stop thinking of combos that start with holds and throws?
Mahito,"(Thoughts) Now that I know his attacks work on me, changing my shape and making his target bigger is a bad idea."
"Itadori, Mahito",(Thoughts) In that case…
Itadori,"(Thoughts) … even if it takes a hundred or a thousand times, I’ll keep pounding him into a pulp!"
Mahito,"(Thoughts) … I’ll use a shape more honed toward murder, with more inspiration for murder… and manifest it!"
[Action: Mahito transforms his arm into several chains with blades.],
Itadori,Ah!
Mahito,Ngh!
[Action: Itadori dodges Mahito’s attacks and jumps out of the building.],
Mahito,Heh… Hah… Fufufu! 
[Action: Mahito turns his arm into a drill and shoots it at Itadori. Itadori dodges.],
Itadori,Ah… Gah!
[Action: Itadori grabs onto Mahito’s arm and begins to pull.],
Itadori,Ngh… Urahh! Ngh… You can’t keep stretching forever!
Mahito,Heh…
[Action: Mahito’s flesh turns into spikes that pierce through Itadori’s hand.],
Itadori,"Ahh…

Ngh! Urahh!"
[Action: Itadori grabs onto Mahito’s flesh again and pulls him through the hole in the building.],
Mahito,Woah!
[Action: Mahito crashes into the building.],
Mahito,"Ngh…

Most people would let go, you know.

(Thoughts) Spreading my shape too much causes it to lose strength and maneuverability."
Itadori,Urah!
[Action: Itadori punches the ground. A ripple heads toward Mahito.],
Mahito,"Hm?

Oh!"
Itadori,Urahh!
[Action: Itadori punches Mahito in the stomach.],
Mahito,Erk… Hehe!
"[Action: Mahito creates spikes from his stomach, impaling Itadori.]",
Itadori,Ahh… Gah…
Mahito,"Haa… You can’t beat me.

Swap out already…"
Itadori,Gah… Ugh…
[Action: Mahito touches Itadori’s chest.],
Mahito,"… with Sukuna.

Idle Transfiguration.

Ah!"
[Scene: In Sukuna’s domain. Sukuna looks down upon Mahito.],
Sukuna,"You dare touch my soul? Since we both heartily ridiculed that brat together, I’ll allow it once.

There won’t be a second time.

Know your place… fool."
[Scene: In the real world. Itadori grabs Mahito’s head.],
Itadori,"I’m not swapping out. I already told you… I will kill you.

Urahh!"
[Action: Itadori smashes his forehead against Mahito’s.],
Mahito,Gahh…
Itadori,Ngh!
Mahito,Gah…
Itadori,Ngh! Ngh! Urah! Ngh! Grrr!
Mahito,Gahh… Ugh…
Itadori,Urah!
[Action: Itadori kicks Mahito in the face.],
Mahito,Gahh… Ahh…
Itadori,Urahhh!
"[Action: Itadori prepares to punch Mahito, but Mahito appears behind him.]",
Itadori,Huh?
"[Action: Mahito swings at Itadori, but Nanami parries the attack with his knife.]",
Nanami,Ngh…
Mahito,Ohh…
Itadori,Ah… Nanamin…
Nanami,"Phew…

I’ll lecture you later. Tell me the situation."
Itadori,I couldn’t save two people.
Nanami,"(Thoughts) It’s always others first.

Explain your physical state first."
Itadori,"I’m fine, though I’m full of holes."
Nanami,That’s not fine.
Itadori,"Also, everyone from this school is unconscious in the gym."
Mahito,"Hey, you’re alive and well 7:3 sorcerer! Glad to see we both survived.

Shall we share a hug in celebration of our reunion?"
[Action: Nanami notices that Mahito’s nose is bleeding.],
Nanami,"Itadori-kun, why is his nose bleeding?"
Itadori,Huh? I punched him.
Nanami,When?
Itadori,At the start of our fight.
Nanami,Did his hand touch you?
Itadori,Yeah.
Nanami,My attacks won’t work on him.
Itadori,Huh? What? Why?
Nanami,"I’ll explain while I’m lecturing you.

(Thoughts) One, his technique doesn’t work on Itadori-kun, or two, there’s some reason why he won’t kill Itadori-kun. Either way, that’s good for us.

However, I can halt his movements.

Once we’ve both created an opening, we’ll shower him with blows.

We’ll make sure to exorcize him here."
Itadori,Yeah!
[Scene: At Satozakura High School. Itadori and Nanami face off against Mahito.],
Nanami,"Itadori-kun, why is his nose bleeding?"
Itadori,Huh? I punched him.
Nanami,When?
Itadori,At the start of our fight.
Nanami,Did his hand touch you?
Itadori,Yeah.
Nanami,My attacks won’t work on him.
Itadori,Huh? Wha… Huh? Why?
Nanami,"I’ll explain while I’m lecturing you.

(Thoughts) One, his technique doesn’t work on Itadori-kun, or two, there’s some reason why he won’t kill Itadori-kun. Either way, that’s good for us.

However, I can halt his movements.

Once we’ve both created an opening, we’ll shower him with blows.

We’ll make sure to exorcize him here."
Itadori,Yeah!
Mahito,(Thoughts) I’ll keep an eye on Itadori Yuuji… while I start by taking care of the 7:3 sorcerer.
[Action: Mahito launches forward. Itadori and Nanami launch their own attacks.],
Mahito,"Hmph… Heh!

Ngh… Urah!"
Itadori,Ngh… Ugh…
Mahito,Hah!
[Action: Mahito explodes into a ball of spikes. Itadori and Nanami dodge.],
Itadori,Ngh…
Mahito,(Thoughts) Hmm… I thought this would be a good one.
Nanami,Ngh!
Itadori,Urgh!
Mahito,"(Thoughts) But they just dodged it.

(Thoughts) And after dodging it, they started shaving away the weaker ends. It’s only good for a small fry. Time to stop."
Itadori,Urahh!
"Itadori, Nanami",Ngh!
[Action: Itadori and Nanami attack Mahito from both sides. Mahito escapes the attack.],
Mahito,Heh… Haha!
Nanami,Ngh… Right before he changes shape…
Itadori,… he stores up cursed energy!
Nanami,Good.
Mahito,"Fufufufu!

(Thoughts) Even though I’ve made myself smaller, there’s still the risk of Itadori Yuuji killing me in one blow.

(Thoughts) He really is my natural enemy. I’ll need to make him behave for a bit."
[Action: Mahito spits up a bunch of transfigured humans.],
Mahito,Blegh…
Nanami,(Thoughts) Transfigured humans! He still had a stockpile of them?
[Action: Mahito releases his transfigured humans.],
Curses,Grr… Grrr…
Mahito,Kill the short-haired brat.
Nanami,Ngh… Ugh!
Curses,Grrr!
Mahito,Fufu…
[Action: The curses attack Itadori. Mahito attacks Nanami.],
Nanami,Ngh…
Mahito,I knew it. He can’t kill humans!
[Action: Itadori runs away from the transfigured humans while trying not to hurt them.],
Itadori,Ah! Ahh… Ngh… Ugh…
Curses,Grrr… Urahhh…
Itadori,Ngh!
[Action: Itadori grabs the throat of one of the curses.],
Curse,Urahh…
Itadori,Ah…
Curse,Le… Le… Le… Let’s play…
Itadori,Ah…
Curses,Grr… Urahh!
[Action: The other curses jump at Itadori. Itadori dodges the attack.],
Itadori,Ah… Ngh… Ugh!
Curses,Urahh!
[Action: The three curses attack Itadori and pin him down.],
Itadori,Ngh! Ugh…
Curse,Please… kill me…
Itadori,Ah…
[Action: Mahito pins Nanami against the wall.],
Mahito,"Next, I’ll have him attack you, too. I wonder if he’ll cry then. He’s a foolish brat who can’t reconcile reality and his ideals."
Nanami,"You’re wrong. He’s in the middle of making that reconciliation. If it were up to me, I’d say you’re the fool."
[Action: Itadori jumps down from the building rooftop.],
Itadori,Ngh!
Mahito,"Fufufu!

Did you kill them?"
[Action: Nanami swings at Mahito.],
Mahito,(Thoughts) They know my tricks now. I’m changing shape right before the moment of impact!
[Action: Itadori and Nanami begin beating on Mahito.],
Mahito,"Blegh! Ugh… Ugh!

Ugh… Gah… Ugh… Gahh!

(Thoughts) I don’t have time to create a substitute. Ah, what… what fresh inspiration this is!

(Thoughts) Is this… death?!

Fufu… Fufufu… Fufufufu!

(Thoughts) I bet I could do it now.

(Thoughts) Domain Expansion."
[Action: Mahito expands his domain.],
"Itadori, Nanami",Ah!
Itadori,Ngh!
[Scene: In Mahito’s domain. Nanami is caught.],
Mahito,(Thoughts) Self-Embodiment of Perfection!
Nanami,Shit.
Mahito,"Right now, I’m just… grateful to you."
,
,
,
[Scene: At Satozakura High School. Itadori tries to break into Mahito’s domain.],
Itadori,"Ngh! Ngh! Ugh! Ngh… Urah! Shit!

Ugh… Ngh… Ngh… Urah!

(Thoughts) Why did he only seal Nanamin inside?! At this rate… At this rate…!"
[Scene: In Mahito’s domain. Nanami analyzes the situation.],
Nanami,"(Thoughts) Domain Expansion. Within an innate domain constructed with cursed energy, their ultimate technique becomes one guaranteed to hit. It’s the height of jujutsu sorcery I could never obtain.

(Thoughts) Most likely, his cursed technique requires touching the target with his palm in its base state in order to interfere with their soul. However, in a domain that guarantees a hit, that would mean I’m… literally in the palm of his hand now.

(Thoughts) Shit. Jujutsu sorcerers are shit. They have to be prepared to cast away their lives for others, and to occasionally force their comrades to do so. That’s why I quit… or more like I ran away."
,
"[Scene: In the past, during Nanami’s time as an office worker. Nanami buys a sandwich from a bakery.]",
Cashier,Do you like casse-croute?
Nanami,Huh?
Cashier,"Huh?

You always buy this one, don’t you?"
Nanami,"Oh, uh, yes. They stopped selling it at my local convenience store."
Cashier,"It’s much better than a convenience store’s, isn’t it?"
Nanami,"Well, you are a bakery."
Cashier,"Wow, harsh."
[Action: Nanami leaves the store.],
Cashier,Please come back again!
Nanami,(Thoughts) A fly head…
Curse,Grr…
Nanami,(Thoughts) Leaving it alone won’t hurt anything.
Curse,Mm…
Nanami,(Thoughts) It’d be a bigger pain to deal with it and have her think I’m some weird medium.
[Scene: At work. Nanami mentors a coworker.],
Boss,"Hello, everybody! You making those sales?"
Nanami,"When people trust us with their money, they’re trusting us with their lives, so it goes without saying that we have to balance the pursuit of profit against the risks. There’s no need to do anything special at the start. Just be sincere with the clients."
Man,Mm.
Nanami,Never forget that.
Man,Right!
Boss,"Nanami, don’t be so prudish all the time. You’re scaring the virgin.

So, new boy, what you need to think about first and foremost are the company’s profits. They’re directly connected to our clients’ profits, too!"
Nanami,Even when we con the client into buying shitty stocks with no growth potential?
Boss,"Of course! It’s suitable payment for us staring at the markets around the clock. Nanami, this is your second year, right? You’re clever. Let yourself run a bit more wild! I have high expectations for you."
Nanami,"(Thoughts) I’m someone with no concept of a “reason for living” or “something worth doing”. I’ll just earn a reasonable amount of money by the time I’m 30 or 40 and enjoy the rest of my aimless life in a country with a low cost of living.

(Thoughts) It’s been four years since I left the school. Whether I’m awake or asleep, all I think about is money. Curses and other people have nothing to do with me as long as I have money.

(Thoughts) Money… Money… Money…

(Thoughts) Money, money… As long as I have money…"
"[Scene: The next morning, at the bakery. Nanami buys another sandwich.]",
Cashier,Are you all right? Are you getting enough sleep?
Nanami,What about you? You look like your fatigue’s been building up.
Cashier,"Oh, you can tell?

Lately, it feels like there’s a weight on my shoulder. I haven’t been sleeping well, either."
Nanami,My job…
Cashier,Hm?
Nanami,"… is to take money from the wealthy and make those people even more wealthy. That’s pretty much all it is.

Frankly, no one would mind if I was gone. People who wanted to eat bread would mind if their bakery was gone.

Yet for some reason, my job, which exists outside that natural human cycle, pays better. When you think about it logically, it makes no sense."
Cashier,Err… A-Are you bragging?
Nanami,"No, I’m not."
Curse,Grr…
Cashier,"Hehehe… Sorry, that was a bit complicated for me! Fufu…"
Nanami,"Could you take a step forward, please?"
Curse,Grr?
Cashier,Huh?
[Action: Nanami waves his arm and exorcizes the curse.],
Curse,Grahh!
Cashier,Huh?
Nanami,How’s your shoulder now?
Cashier,Huh? Well…
[Action: The cashier moves her shoulder around freely.],
Cashier,Huh? It’s lighter!
Nanami,"If anything still feels off, please go to the hospital. Please excuse me."
[Action: Nanami takes his sandwich and heads for the door.],
Cashier,"Wow… Hey, wait!

Ngh… Hold on! Hey!

Thank you! Please come back again!"
Nanami,(Thoughts) “Thank you.”
Cashier,Huh? Didn’t you hear me? Thank you! Please come back again!
Nanami,(Thoughts) I always thought I was a person with no concept of a “reason for living”.
[Action: Nanami calls Gojou on his phone.],
Nanami,"Hello, it’s Nanami. I need to talk to you.

Yes, I’ll be stopping by Jujutsu Tech tomorrow…

Why are you laughing?"
,
"[Scene: In the present, in Mahito’s domain. Mahito prepares to kill Nanami.]",
Mahito,Idle Transfiguration. I’m grateful to you.
Nanami,"I don’t need your gratitude.

I’ve already received it from lots of others.

I have no regrets."
Mahito,Heh…
[Action: Itadori breaks into Mahito’s domain.],
Mahito,Ah…
Nanami,Ah…
Itadori,Ngh!
Mahito,(Thoughts) How was he able to get in?
Nanami,"(Thoughts) That’s right… The more resistant the inside of the barrier is, the weaker it is to attacks from outside.

(Thoughts) Domains are barriers specialized in trapping something inside, so they’re actually easy to invade.

(Thoughts) The reason why is because there’s no merit in doing so.

(Thoughts) With Domains like Infinite Void and Self-Embodiment of Perfection, which guarantee victory once they’ve ensnared their target, that’s even more true.

(Thoughts) However, inside Itadori-kun, there lies something that must not be touched!"
[Scene: In Sukuna’s domain. Sukuna admonishes Mahito.],
Sukuna,I warned you… that there wouldn’t be a second time.
[Scene: In Mahito’s domain. Mahito suddenly has a wound in his chest.],
Nanami,Ah…
Itadori,Ah…
Nanami,(Thoughts) There’s no one in this world more proud and conceited. He lives guided by only his pleasure and displeasure!
Sukuna,"(Thoughts) Whether you die or you die doesn’t matter.

(Thoughts) Aside from him, I truly don’t care."
[Action: Mahito’s domain explodes.],
Mahito,Ahhh…
,
,
,
[Scene: At Satozakura High School. Mahito holds onto his wound.],
Mahito,Ngh… Ugh…
Itadori,"(Thoughts) What just happened?

Ngh… Ngh!"
[Action: Itadori charges at Mahito.],
Itadori,(Thoughts) I’ll kill you!
Mahito,"(Thoughts) Domain Expansion… That really burns cursed energy. It truly is a trump card, a final technique. And that damn Sukuna just…

(Thoughts) But this is the critical moment! Squeeze it out! The last of my cursed energy!"
[Action: Mahito’s body expands.],
Mahito,Ahhh…
Itadori,"Ah…

(Thoughts) The target’s huge. The flow of cursed energy is calm.

(Thoughts) There are no counters. I can land my attack for certain. This is my last chance.

(Thoughts) I don’t need any more tactics!

(Thoughts) Divergent Fist!"
"[Action: Itadori punches Mahito’s stomach, sending cursed energy through his body. Mahito’s body pops.]",
Itadori,"Ah…

(Thoughts) Wh-What is this lack of feedback?

Ah!"
[Action: Mahito’s popped body heads into a sewer grate.],
Mahito,Bye-bye.
Itadori,Hold it!
Mahito,This was fun.
Nanami,Ngh!
"[Action: Nanami swings at the sewer grate, but Mahito is gone.]",
Nanami,Tsk…
[Action: Nanami calls Ino on his phone.],
Nanami,"Ino-kun, the core has escaped into the sewers.

Yes. Please scour everything from my current location to the southeast. Even you could exorcize him right now."
[Action: Nanami hangs up the phone.],
Nanami,"Let’s pursue him, too!

Huh?"
[Action: Itadori falls to the ground.],
Nanami,Itadori-kun!
Itadori,"(Thoughts) Come on, body! Move! You’re going to kill that thing, aren’t you?!

(Thoughts) You’re going to crush him… into a pulp…"
Nanami,Itadori-kun! Itadori-kun!
[Action: Itadori loses consciousness.],
,
[Scene: In the sewer. Mahito struggles to move.],
Mahito,"Ahh… Haa… Ngh… Ugh…

Fufufufu… Hehehe… Haa…

(Thoughts) So that was the King of Curses, Ryoumen Sukuna. He should have less total cursed energy than Jougo at this point in time, and yet that presence… His soul’s on a different level.

(Thoughts) I’m certain of it. Even if we’re all wiped out, so long as Sukuna is resurrected, the age of curses will come.

(Thoughts) Still, damn, this sucks. Right now, I want nothing more than to kill Itadori Yuuji!

Mmm… It’s so frustrating! But whatever. Unlike his body, I can kill his soul over and over again.

How should I kill it next time? Fufu…"
,
[Scene: In a morgue. Itadori and Nanami meet among the dead bodies.],
Nanami,"You were told to rest, weren’t you?"
Itadori,Is this my lecture?
Nanami,I have no lecture to give to the person who saved my life.
Itadori,I saved you?
Nanami,"That patchwork’s cursed technique was interfering with the soul. Since you invaded his domain, he wound up touching Sukuna’s soul. I was saved because of that."
Itadori,But I didn’t swap with him.
Nanami,Sukuna never came out. Our opponent went in.
Itadori,"Then it wasn’t me who saved you. It was just his whim.

Nanamin, I killed a person today.

People die. There’s no stopping that, so I wanted them to at least have proper deaths.

That’s what I thought, so I was always thinking about how I could keep that trigger from being pulled. But… after pulling that trigger myself, I don’t understand anymore.

What is a proper death?"
Nanami,"I don’t know what that is, either.

Even if good people dying in peace and evil people being punished with death is the proper way, most of the people in this world are neither good nor evil. Death is the final destination for all of us, but no one dies the same death. Trying to guide all of them to their proper end would surely be arduous. I personally wouldn’t recommend it.

But you’ll still do it anyway, won’t you?

Just don’t end up dying yourself in the process. Just as I would’ve died today if you hadn’t been there, you’ll see there are plenty of people yet to come that need you, too.

Because you’re a jujutsu sorcerer now, Itadori-kun."
Itadori,Ngh…
,
[Scene: At Satozakura High School. The students and teachers go about their lives. The students fill out a survey on bullying.],
Teacher,Put it in this box once you’ve filled it out. And you don’t need to write your name.
[Scene: In a private office. Sotomura confronts Itou.],
Sotomura,"You’re the one who gave Yoshino those scars, aren’t you, Itou?"
Itou,"I don’t want to hear any bitching from the guy who was too scared to do anything at the time.

He quit school and moved away, didn’t he? So who cares?

What about me? I’ve barely been able to move my left arm since that day."
Sotomura,We’re talking about your crimes right now. Reflect on the punishment you earned by yourself.
Itou,And where’s your punishment?
Sotomura,"Mine is yet to come. First, I need to take a proper look at the things I couldn’t see.

Both you and I will have to bear the crime of killing Yoshino’s heart for the rest of our lives.

I’ll be watching you, Itou!"
,
[Scene: At Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School. Itadori finds Gojou and Nanami.],
Itadori,(Thoughts) I don’t understand what a proper death is. So at least… until I do understand… until I kill him… I won’t… lose again.
[Scene: At a hot spring. Jougo relaxes and smokes a pipe.],
Curse,"No!

Ughh…"
Mahito,"Oh, there you are!"
Jougo,Huh?
Mahito,"Fufufu!

Mm… Haha… Jougo! Haha!"
[Action: Mahito jumps into the hot spring.],
Jougo,Tsk…
Mahito,Looks like most of your body’s back.
Jougo,"Yeah, this place is relaxing. Humans don’t come anywhere near it."
Mahito,"Lacking a body really is a problem.

It makes self-preservation so inefficient."
Jougo,"Mahito, you’re awfully worn down yourself."
Mahito,"Oh, you could tell? Sukuna and his vessel are my natural enemies.

I started this game because I happened to acquire a new toy, but it just didn’t go so well. It was great at first, though.

Are you sure I shouldn’t have just used a hostage to force him into a pact? Like, “Hand your body over to Sukuna if you don’t want to see him killed.”"
Itadori,(Imagination) Grr!
Kenjaku,"No, pacts are only placed by oneself on oneself. It’s not easy to forget pacts with others or due to intervention from others."
Mahito,(Thoughts) Maybe I should have just given that thing a lethal wound instead of transfiguring it. Then Sukuna might have been able to heal it with his reverse cursed technique.
Sukuna,"(Flashback) Know your place, fool."
Mahito,"(Thoughts) No, not with that personality. I think he would have refused either way."
[Action: Mahito gets out of the water.],
Mahito,Jougo… Touching Sukuna made me realize that we should probably proceed with Getou’s plan for now. Sukuna is that valuable.
Jougo,"Ngh…

Gather all the fingers and offer them to Sukuna, huh?

Even if we’re all wiped out in the process, eh?

Very well. I don’t need to be the one laughing in the wasteland a century from now. As long as curses stand there as people, that’s all that matters."
Mahito,"Oh, you get it!"
Kenjaku,"Then first, let’s go retrieve the six fingers Jujutsu Tech has."
Jougo,"Is that necessary? The sorcerers are only keeping Itadori Yuuji around so he can take in Sukuna’s fingers, right? He’ll still eat them, even if we leave them be."
Kenjaku,"The higher-ups at Jujutsu Tech are struggling to measure Itadori Yuuji’s strength as a vessel to see how many he can take before he goes berserk.

They won’t let him take them in until they’ve gathered all the fingers… with just one exception."
Gojou,(Imagination) I want to feed them to him right away!
Kenjaku,"And we can’t wait that long, right? Worst case, there’s also a chance they’ll eliminate Itadori Yuuji."
Jougo,"Into the tiger’s den, huh? Well, what should we do, then?"
Kenjaku,I’ve already taken steps. That’s why I allowed Jujutsu Tech to retrieve the fingers we had.
,
,
,
[Scene: In a lobby at Jujutsu Tech. Gojou is bored. Nanami reads a newspaper.],
Gojou,"Nanami, talk about something interesting."
Nanami,Phew…
Gojou,"Okay, I’ve got it!

Let’s play catch with discarded rice balls while discussing the separation of church and state! Let’s post a video of it and troll people!"
Nanami,"Enjoy that on your own.

(Thoughts) What kind of idea is that?"
Gojou,"Drinking game time! Name things you love about Gojou Satoru!

Everything!"
Nanami,Please keep that attitude going. Itadori-kun needs that kind of idiocy right now.
Gojou,"(Flashback) You’ll take on and complete several harder missions.

That wasn’t what I meant by “harder”, though.

Nanami, does Yuuji know about that finger in Yoshino’s --"
Nanami,"I haven’t told him. Knowing him, he’d just feel unnecessarily responsible."
Gojou,I’m glad I left you in charge. And the finger?
Nanami,"I submitted it to the higher-ups, of course. If I gave it to you, you’d just feed it to Itadori-kun, right?"
Gojou,Tsk…
Nanami,"But is it really okay to bring him back? If the fact that he’s alive becomes known at the Exchange Event, won’t the higher-ups just target him again?"
Gojou,"Even if they do, Yuuji will be just fine now. You know that better than anyone, don’t you?"
Nanami,Haa…
[Action: Itadori enters the room.],
Itadori,"Ah!

Sensei!

Oh, Nanami’s here, too.

Well, come on! Let’s hurry up and go see everyone!

So excited! So excited! So excited! So excited!"
Gojou,"Yuuji, are you planning to just show up like normal after dragging it out this long?"
Itadori,Huh? I can’t?
Gojou,"Even among sorcerers, you rarely see someone say they’ve actually been alive two whole months after they died.

We have to make it a surprise!"
Itadori,A surprise?
Gojou,Just leave it to me.
Itadori,Huh?
Gojou,The first-years will be laughing and crying from happiness and shock…
Fushiguro,(Imagination) You’re alive…
Kugisaki,(Imagination) I’m so glad!
Gojou,"… and the second-years and Kyoto students will cry with them, and someone among them will choke up and vomit…"
Kugisaki,"(Imagination) Thank goodness! Thank goodness!

(Imagination) Blegh! Blegh!"
Gojou,"… and in the end, it’ll even solve global warming!"
Itadori,"Sweet!

What do I do?! Sensei, what should I do?!"
Gojou,You don’t have to do anything! Just do exactly as I say and go with the flow!
Itadori,So what should I do?
Nanami,It’ll be enough of a surprise just to see he’s alive.
,
[Scene: Elsewhere in the school. Kugisaki drops a travel magazine.],
Kugisaki,Wha… Why are you all empty-handed?!
Group,Huh?
Panda,What are you doing with all that luggage?
Kugisaki,"What do you mean? We’re going to Kyoto, right? For the Exchange Event with our sister school in Kyoto?"
Panda,"It’s an exchange event with our sister school in Kyoto, held in Tokyo."
Kugisaki,No way!
Maki,No wonder our conversations have been a bit off lately.
Fushiguro,Yeah.
Inumaki,Salmon.
Panda,It’s held at the school that won in the previous year.
[Action: Kugisaki holds Panda’s skin like she would a shirt collar.],
Panda,Erk…
Kugisaki,"Then don’t go winning, you idiots!"
Panda,We weren’t in it last year! Only Yuuta participated to make the numbers match up!
Maki,"That was prior to freeing Rika.

Apparently, it was an overwhelming win. I didn’t see it, though, since it was held in Kyoto."
Kugisaki,"I won’t forgive you, Okkotsu Yuuta! Not that I’ve ever even met you!"
Panda,That’s misdirected anger.
Inumaki,Salmon.
Maki,Huh?
[Action: The Kyoto students arrive.],
Maki,Hey. They’re here.
Mai,"Oh, look. It’s everyone from Tokyo together.

You went out of your way to greet us?

Disgusting."
Toudou,Okkotsu’s not here.
Kugisaki,"Shut up. Hurry up and hand over the cake box, and the yatsuhashi, kudzu noodles, and buckwheat noodles."
Inumaki,Salmon.
Toudou,You guys hungry?
Nishimiya,Who is that first-year? She’s scary.
Mechamaru,Never mind Okkotsu being absent. Isn’t having two first-years a major handicap?
Kugisaki,A robot! It’s a robot!
Kamo,"Age is irrelevant to jujutsu sorcerers.

Especially with Fushiguro-kun.

He’s from the Zenin bloodline, but he’s more talented than the head of the clan."
Mai,Tsk…
Kamo,Something to say?
Mai,Nope.
Miwa,"Now, now… Please calm down, you two."
[Action: Iori walks up the steps.],
Iori,"Okay, now. Let’s not fight amongst ourselves. My goodness, these children.

So, where’s that idiot?"
Panda,Satoru’s late.
Maki,As if that idiot would ever show up on time.
Fushiguro,No one said “idiot” referred to Gojou-sensei.
Students,Hm?
[Action: Gojou arrives while pushing a cart with a box on it.],
Gojou,Sorry for the wait!
Iori,Tsk… Gojou Satoru.
Miwa,(Thoughts) Gojou Satoru!
Gojou,"Hey, I see everyone’s together! I was on a business trip overseas, so I will not hand out souvenirs!"
Panda,This is sudden.
Kugisaki,You sure it’s not jet lag?
[Action: Gojou begins handing out charms.],
Gojou,"Okay, everyone from Kyoto gets this protective charm from a particular tribe."
Toudou,Hm?
Gojou,"None for you, Utahime."
Miwa,Wow…
Iori,I don’t need one!
Gojou,"And for everyone from Tokyo, we have this!"
Kugisaki,Overly excited adults are creepy.
[Action: The box on Gojou’s cart opens. Itadori pops out.],
Itadori,Hey! OPP!
Gojou,"It’s your departed friend, Itadori Yuuji-kun!"
"Fushiguro, Kugisaki",Ahh…
Itadori,"(Thoughts) Huh?!

(Thoughts) Huh? Huh?! They don’t seem happy at all!

(Thoughts) N-No way…"
Gojou,"Okay, everyone from Kyoto! This is Sukuna’s vessel, Itadori Yuuji-kun!"
Itadori,"(Thoughts) The ones from Kyoto… are too absorbed in their souvenirs!

Ah… Ahh…"
Gakuganji,Sukuna’s vessel?! What’s the meaning of this?
Gojou,"Ah… Principal Gakuganji! Oh, thank goodness.

I was worried you might just die from the shock."
Gakuganji,You damn brat!
Gojou,Fufufufu… Fufufufu…
[Action: Kugisaki kicks Itadori’s box.],
Itadori,Ah!
Kugisaki,Hey.
Itadori,"Uh, yes?"
Kugisaki,You got something to say?
Itadori,Huh? Ahh…
Kugisaki,Ngh…
Itadori,I’m sorry for keeping quiet about being alive…
,
,
,
[Scene: At Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School. The Exchange Event begins.],
Yaga,"The Tokyo-Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event will be held over two days. The first day is a group battle… The Wacky Cursed Spirit Exorcism Race!

The rules are simple. The first team to exorcize the second-grade cursed spirit released in the area wins.

Several third-grade and lower cursed spirits will be released into the designated area, as well. If a winner is not decided by sundown, the team that exorcizes the most wins. There are absolutely no other rules.

Of course, you’re welcome to sabotage the others, but remember, you’re all on the same side in the fight against the curses.

This Exchange Event will allow you to learn about yourselves and your comrades through competition."
[Action: Gojou struggles in Yaga’s hold.],
Gojou,Ngh…
Yaga,Be certain not to kill other competitors or injure them beyond recovery.
Iori,Fufufu… Fufu…
Yaga,That’s it. You’re all dismissed until the event commences at noon!
,
"[Scene: Sometime later, in a meeting room. The Tokyo students gather for a meeting. Itadori holds a funeral photo frame around his head.]",
Itadori,"Um… Depending on how you look at it, this could be considered very extreme bullying."
Kugisaki,Shut up and stay that way for a while.
Panda,"Now, now… You heard his explanation. Cut him some slack."
Itadori,The panda talked!
Inumaki,"Salmon, salmon."
Itadori,What?
Fushiguro,Inumaki-senpai is a cursed speech user. Cursed speech is a technique that amplifies the power and compulsion of words. He limits his vocabulary to keep others safe.
Itadori,"So if he told someone to go die, they’d actually die? That’s really powerful."
Panda,"It’s nothing that convenient. It’s all case by case, depending on their difference in strength. If he uses powerful words, he’s hit with massive feedback. Worse case, it would affect him.

Limiting his vocabulary is a way for Toge to protect himself, as well."
Itadori,"Oh? So how are you able to speak, Senpai? Are you some new breed of panda?"
Kugisaki,Blabbing on about people’s techniques…
Maki,"It’s fine. Toge’s isn’t that kind of technique, anyway.

More importantly, Yuuji…"
Itadori,Huh?
Maki,"… give me back Slaughter Demon.

You borrowed it from Satoru, right?"
Itadori,Hmm…
Gojou,"(Imagination) Gimme!

(Imagination) Here you go!"
Itadori,(Imagination) I broke it.
Maki,(Imagination) It’s not coming back!
Itadori,"Eek!

Gojou-sensei… has it…"
Maki,Tsk… That blindfolded dumbass!
Fushiguro,Hmm…
[Action: Gojou sneezes.],
Iori,Ngh… Gross.
Maki,"So, what’s the plan?

The group format is what we expected, but we have another member now. Do we change strategies? There’s not much time."
Inumaki,Bonito flakes.
Panda,"Well, that depends on Yuuji. What can you do?"
Itadori,"Punch, kick…"
Panda,We have enough of that.
Itadori,Huh?
Fushiguro,"I don’t know what he’s been doing since he’s been dead, but if everyone from Tokyo and Kyoto fought him at once without cursed energy, Itadori would win."
Panda,Oh?
Maki,"(Thoughts) Megumi’s saying that after fighting Toudou?

(Thoughts) That makes it convincing. Interesting."
,
[Scene: In another meeting room. The Kyoto students meet.],
Gakuganji,"Kill Sukuna’s vessel, Itadori Yuuji. He’s not a person, so it will go unquestioned. It’ll be treated as an accident. There’s no need to hold back or hesitate."
Miwa,(Thoughts) I don’t want to…
Mai,"You say to kill him, but he’s here because he didn’t die, right?"
Gakuganji,"I’ve heard that Itadori’s previous death was suicide. What is the one thing you must be cautious about when ending a hostile sorcerer, Kamo?"
Kamo,Yes. You must kill them with cursed energy to prevent them from coming back as a curse after death.
Gakuganji,"Exactly. If another delivers the finishing blow with cursed energy, then all is well. At present, Itadori Yuuji has control of the body. Unless Sukuna comes out, he’s just a first-year. Killing him will be --"
Toudou,Ngh!
[Action: Toudou kicks out the sliding door.],
Toudou,This is stupid. Do what you want.
[Action: Toudou prepares to leave.],
Kamo,"Come back, Toudou.

The principal isn’t finished yet."
Toudou,Takada-chan’s making a guest appearance on a walking show at 11. Do I need to explain any more?
Kamo,You can record it. Come back here.
Toudou,"I’m going to watch the recording and watch it in real time!

Who do you take me for?"
Mai,(Thoughts) That’s your problem here?
Toudou,"Listen, all of you. You listen, too, old man! I’ve long been disappointed in you all and your bad taste in women. Plot and scheme all you want on your own.

But if you try to order me around again, I’ll kill you."
[Action: Toudou and Gakuganji leave the room.],
Miwa,"What do we do now? I don’t think we’ll be able to carry out the plan with him like that. The principal’s gone off somewhere, too. I don’t want to be killed by that guy."
Nishimiya,"Does it even matter?

He’s going to go straight for the Tokyo team, anyway. If he’s just going to go berserk, we can focus on the game."
Mai,"But we have to kill Itadori Yuuji, right?"
Miwa,(Thoughts) We’re seriously doing this?
Mai,I don’t think he’ll go as far as killing him. Though he probably could.
Mechamaru,Then we’ll need someone to keep an eye on Toudou and deliver the final blow to Itadori Yuuji.
Miwa,"(Thoughts) I don’t like this!

We’ll have cursed spirits to deal with, too, so we’ll be in two-man cells, anyway. That works out for us."
Kamo,"No.

Allowing a half-wit like Itadori Yuuji to be a sorcerer at Jujutsu Tech is a serious problem.

It goes beyond this Exchange Event. I cannot overlook this as the eldest son of the Kamo clan.

We’re all attacking Itadori Yuuji together."
Nishimiya,"Hold on. What happens if Inumaki-kun is with Itadori-kun?

Having all of us in one place is a risky move with that cursed speech user. Worst case, he could wipe all of us out at once."
Mechamaru,That’s true.
Kamo,"No, if you know he’s coming, he’s not that scary to face."
Mai,"Let me have Maki. That brown-haired first-year, too, if possible."
Kamo,You’re sounding just like Toudou.
Mai,Grr…!
,
[Scene: In the staff room. Gojou and Iori drink tea.],
Iori,So what did you want?
Gojou,Huh? Why are you mad?
Iori,"I’m not mad, actually."
Gojou,"Right? I haven’t done anything, after all."
Iori,Ngh…
Gojou,There’s someone working with either a curse user or curses at Jujutsu Tech.
Iori,"Ah… Impossible! A curse user might be one thing, but working with curses?"
Gojou,"A lot of them on that level have been popping up lately.

They understand human speech, and they’ve formed a faction that’s operating with purpose. They might think they’re just working with a curse user.

I’d like to ask you to handle investigating those at Kyoto, Utahime."
Iori,What would you do if I was the traitor?
Gojou,"No way. You’re weak, and you don’t have the guts --"
"[Action: Iori throws her tea at Gojou, but it doesn’t hit him.]",
Gojou,"Scary! Hysterics won’t win men, you know."
Iori,I am the senior here!
,
[Scene: On a walkway. The Tokyo students prepare for the competition.],
Fushiguro,Itadori.
Itadori,Hm?
Fushiguro,You okay?
Itadori,"Yeah, sounds like I’ve got a big role, but I’ll manage."
Fushiguro,"I’m not talking about that. Something happened, right?"
Itadori,"Huh? Nothing happened.

Okay, it did.

But it’s true that I’m fine.

In fact, because of what happened, I don’t want to lose to anyone."
Fushiguro,"Okay, then. I don’t really want to lose, either."
Kugisaki,What do you mean “really”? You already got sent rolling around once!
"[Action: Fushiguro, Kugisaki, Maki, Panda, and Inumaki begin walking toward the entrance.]",
Kugisaki,"Overwhelm them! Let’s thoroughly trounce them! For Maki-san’s sake, too!"
Maki,Don’t say stuff like that.
Inumaki,Pollack roe!
Panda,"Yeah! For Maki-san’s sake, too!"
Maki,Don’t say stuff like that!
Itadori,Hehe…
[Action: Itadori joins the rest of the students at the start line.],
Itadori,"Well, in that case… let’s win!"
[Action: Maki kicks Itadori in the back.],
Maki,What are you doing taking the lead?
Itadori,Ow.
[Scene: In an observation room. Gojou makes an announcement.],
Gojou,"We’re starting in one minute.

Now, let’s hear a few words of well-appreciated encouragement from Iori Utahime-sensei."
Iori,"Huh?! U-Uh… Um, some degree of injury will be unavoidable, but, um… now and then, help each other out… or something…"
Gojou,Time’s up.
Iori,"Hey! Gojou, you little…!"
Gojou,"Now, let the Sister School Exchange Event… begin!"
Iori,Respect your seniors!
[Scene: In the field. Each team runs into the forest.],
Itadori,Ichirou?
Kugisaki,So stupid.
Kamo,Where’s Toudou?
Mai,What makes you think I would know?
Miwa,(Thoughts) Can’t we all get along?
Itadori,Where do you think the cursed spirit boss is?
Panda,"It was probably unleashed halfway between both schools, but it’s not just going to sit still."
Maki,"At the time we agreed upon, we’ll split up into the Megumi squad and the Panda squad for scouting.

We’ll be counting on you after that, Yuuji."
Itadori,Yeah!
[Action: Fushiguro’s Demon Dog runs ahead.],
Demon Dog,"Woof, woof!"
Curse,Where are you going?
Panda,That’s a small fry.
[Action: Maki prepares to attack the curse.],
Demon Dog,Grr…
Fushiguro,"Senpai, stop!"
Curse,Grrr…
Toudou,Urahh!
[Action: Toudou blasts the curse away.],
Toudou,Great! You’re all here! Come at me all together!
Itadori,Ngh!
[Action: Itadori charges at Toudou and knees him in the face.],
Itadori,Ngh!
Maki,Scatter!
[Action: The rest of the Tokyo team splits up and runs ahead.],
Fushiguro,Toudou was alone.
Maki,We were right to swap Yuuji into that role.
Kugisaki,"I already knew it, but he’s a monster."
Panda,Yep. So just ignore him.
Inumaki,Tuna.
Toudou,Grr!
[Action: Itadori kicks Toudou away.],
Toudou,"Ngh…

Fufu…"
,
,
,
"[Scene: Sometime earlier, in the Tokyo team meeting room. The Tokyo team members strategize.]",
Maki,"Toudou will absolutely be out to crush us straight away. Mai might follow behind him to come after me, too.

Toudou’s a monster. The worst possible outcome would be that we all face him and get wiped out.

So our plan was to leave just one person, either Panda or Megumi, behind to occupy him, but… Itadori, we’ll leave that role to you."
Itadori,Huh?
Maki,"We’d rather not lose anyone who can scout out our enemies.

You don’t have to beat him. Just hold out as long as possible and buy us time."
Panda,"But you can be daring against him! To be blunt, we weren’t counting on your abilities, anyway, so it won’t affect us too much if you have to quit."
Itadori,That’s mean!
Panda,"Sorry, Megumi. You wanted to face Toudou, didn’t you?"
Fushiguro,"No, I’m good either way."
Panda,You’re super dry.
Itadori,"But, Senpai, if I’m gonna do this…"
"Maki, Panda",Huh?
Itadori,… then I’m gonna win.
,
"[Scene: In the present, in the forest. Itadori prepares to fight Toudou. Toudou spits on the ground.]",
Toudou,Nice speed.
Itadori,(Thoughts) Seriously? I thought I landed a good one.
Toudou,"Mmm…

I’ll return the favor, first-year. Guard like your life depends on it!"
[Action: Toudou launches forward. A curse flies in front of Itadori’s face.],
Itadori,Ah…
Curse,Where?
Toudou,Ngh… Urahhh!
[Action: Itadori guards. Toudou smashes through the curse and sends Itadori flying back into a tree.],
Itadori,"Ngh…

Gah! Ugh… Ah…

(Thoughts) My arm’s… still here?

(Thoughts) I thought it got blown off. If that cursed spirit hadn’t gotten in the way, that would have been real bad.

Ngh… Ugh… Ngh…"
[Action: Toudou begins stomping on Itadori’s face.],
Itadori,"Erk!

Ngh! Ngh…"
Toudou,Fufufufu…
Itadori,Gah… Ugh… Ngh… Gah… Ugh…
Toudou,"Urah!

Ngh! Oh…"
[Action: Toudou prepares to punch Itadori but stops. Itadori slumps over.],
Toudou,"Done already?

Heh…

Now, which should I pursue?"
[Action: Itadori claws at the ground.],
Toudou,"Ngh…!

Hehehehe…"
[Action: Itadori gets back up.],
Toudou,Are you for real?
Itadori,You think you can just pound away at my head like that? What if you made me even dumber than I already am?!
Toudou,"Don’t worry. Takada-chan said, “Men are perfect when they’re a little dumb.”"
Itadori,Who’s that? I’m not interested in any idols.
Toudou,"Then how did you know she’s an idol? You know who she is, don’t you?

What’s your name, first-year?"
Itadori,Itadori Yuuji.
Toudou,"I see. Itadori Yuuji. I have one question for you.

What kind of woman is your type?"
Itadori,"Huh?

What’s my type? Why are you asking me that right now?"
Toudou,Don’t worry about that. I’m just appraising you.
Itadori,"I don’t really get it, but if I had to say… a tall woman with a big ass, I guess? Like Jennifer Lawrence."
Toudou,"Ah!

Ahh…"
[Scene: In Toudou’s imagination. Toudou imagines himself and Itadori looking through a magazine.],
Itadori,(Imagination) The new series is pretty good.
Toudou,(Imagination) Oh?
[Action: The school tone chimes.],
Toudou,(Imagination) Ah…
Itadori,(Imagination) Ah…
[Action: Itadori and Toudou return to their classrooms.],
Toudou,(Imagination) I’m going to confess to Takada-chan.
Itadori,(Imagination) Huh?! Don’t do that! I don’t wanna have to comfort you later! That’s such a pain!
Toudou,(Imagination) Why are you assuming she’ll reject me?
Itadori,(Imagination) I could ask you why you think she’ll say yes.
Toudou,"(Imagination) Anne Sullivan once said to Helen Keller, “What fool thinks of defeat before even trying?”"
Itadori,(Imagination) Inoki was the one who said that.
[Action: Takada rips up Toudou’s confession.],
Takada,(Imagination) I’m sorry. I’m already in love with someone.
Toudou,(Imagination) Ahh…
[Action: Toudou meets up with Itadori again.],
Toudou,(Imagination) Any chance that someone is me?
Itadori,"(Imagination) No way, man.

(Imagination) Come on, let’s go.

(Imagination) I’ll treat you to some ramen."
[Scene: In the real world. Toudou cries.],
Toudou,"Ngh… Mmm… You never lost to anyone in your hometown, huh?

Seems like we’re best friends!"
Itadori,When you just learned my name?!
[Action: Nishimiya flies on her broom overhead.],
Nishimiya,"Yeah, continue straight that way. Toudou-kun’s there, though."
Kamo,Not a problem. He’s the one who told us to do as we pleased.
[Action: Mai shoots at Itadori. Itadori dodges the shots.],
Miwa,"(Thoughts) New Shadow Style, Simple Domain…

(Thoughts) Quick Draw!"
[Action: Itadori runs into Miwa’s simple domain but dodges her attack.],
Itadori,"Ngh…

Ngh… Ugh…"
Miwa,"(Thoughts) What reflexes! I know I hesitated, but still, my counter didn’t even scratch him!"
[Action: Mechamaru prepares to blast Itadori.],
Itadori,"(Thoughts) I’m surrounded? 

(Thoughts) Huh?

(Thoughts) Are these guys… trying to kill me?"
"[Action: Toudou claps, putting Itadori in the tree and Kamo on the ground.]",
"Kamo, Mechamaru",Ngh…
"Mai, Miwa",Ah!
Kamo,This is…
Itadori,Huh?
Kamo,(Thoughts) Itadori and I switched places?!
Toudou,"Hey.

Ngh!"
"[Action: Toudou punches at Kamo, but Kamo dodges.]",
Kamo,Ngh…
Toudou,"I told you I’d kill you if you interfered, didn’t I?"
Kamo,"No, you didn’t. You said you’d kill us if we ordered you around.

(Thoughts) Was that Itadori’s… No, was it Toudou’s technique?"
Toudou,Same thing. Piss off!
[Action: Kamo walks away from the area.],
Mechamaru,Looks like he’s retreating.
Mai,Lame.
Miwa,(Thoughts) Thank goodness!
Kamo,Make sure you kill him.
Toudou,That depends on Itadori. Don’t order me around.
Itadori,(Thoughts) What’s with these people trying to kill me and then arguing with each other?
Toudou,"After all, I’m not an inconsiderate man who’d hold back against his best friend!"
[Action: Nishimiya flies overhead and sees the rest of the team except Toudou fleeing.],
Nishimiya,"Ugh… This is why I said to leave him be. We’re off to a rocky start.

(Thoughts) We can’t start hunting down cursed spirits without me scouting from the air, either.

Haa… They’re all such a hassle. Hang in there, me. You’re as cute as ever today."
Fushiguro,Take her down.
[Action: Nue appears above Nishimiya. The air crackles with electricity.],
Nishimiya,"Ah… Oh, no."
[Action: Nishimiya goes flying.],
Kamo,"Mai, Mechamaru, cover Nishimiya."
Mechamaru,At once.
Mai,"Well, we are in trouble without her."
[Action: Mai and Mechamaru split off from Kamo and Miwa. Maki appears by Miwa.],
Miwa,Ah…!
[Action: Maki engages Miwa in battle. Fushiguro engages with Kamo.],
Fushiguro,"Kamo-san, are you guys planning to kill Itadori?"
,
,
,
[Scene: Sometime earlier. The two Tokyo groups have split up.],
Fushiguro,That’s strange.
Panda,"It is strange.

All the Kyoto students are moving together.

They’re heading toward the area we left Yuuji in. I think that puts everyone from Kyoto there."
Maki,You mean that’s where the target is?
Fushiguro,"No. Unless the second-grade is especially cunning, my Demon Dog would have noticed it."
Demon Dog,Woof!
Fushiguro,"They’re trying to kill Itadori, aren’t they?"
Kugisaki,What the hell?! I don’t see why!
Maki,It’s possible.
Inumaki,Kelp.
Panda,"I didn’t sense that much hostility from them, but that was prior to Yuuji’s surprise survival."
Kugisaki,Ah…
Panda,It’s entirely possible that Principal Gakuganji would order that.
Kugisaki,Are the Kyoto students a bunch of cowards who’d kill a person on someone else’s orders?
Panda,"They don’t see him the same way. You two have spent day after day with Yuuji.

We only recently learned that he was a good person ourselves. He’s a naturally happy sort you don’t often see among sorcerers. But the thing is… to those who don’t know anything about Yuuji, the vessel of Sukuna is just an object of fear.

It wouldn’t feel any different from exorcizing a curse to them.Even normal jujutsu sorcerers can easily blur that line."
Maki,"We’re turning back, Megumi."
Fushiguro,Sorry.
Maki,"What are you apologizing for, dummy?

There’s no point in winning or losing the exchange event if your friend dies."
Panda,"Nobara and I will go back to confirm that Yuuji’s safe. He’s not answering his phone, either.

Toge, you keep hunting down the cursed spirit, please."
[Action: Inumaki makes his arms in an “x” shape.],
Inumaki,Bonito flakes!
Panda,"I know you’re worried about Yuuji, too. But if my prediction is correct, the Kyoto students are trying to use the chaos of the group battle to assassinate Yuuji. Once the group battle’s over, there won’t be any assassination."
Kugisaki,Makes sense.
Inumaki,Salmon.
Panda,"I’m worried about Maki, too. We won’t let them kill Yuuji, and we’ll win this group battle."
Kugisaki,Of course.
"[Action: Kugisaki tries to call Fushiguro, but he doesn’t answer after two rings.]",
Kugisaki,"Ugh… Answer on the first ring, Fushiguro!

Also, why didn’t they provide us with wireless radios or Bluetooth earbuds?!"
[Action: Panda and Inumaki wave goodbye. Inumaki runs off.],
Panda,"I wouldn’t want them! They’re distracting, and they startle you when you get a call."
Kugisaki,You can take them off during combat!
,
[Scene: In the present. Nishimiya crashes into a tree after Nue’s attack.],
Nishimiya,"Ngh… Ow…

(Thoughts) So that’s Fushiguro-kun’s Nue, huh? Electrified wings… Looks like they’ll affect my movement for a while."
[Action: Kugisaki and Panda shake the tree Nishimiya is in.],
"Kugisaki, Panda",Nishimiya-chan! Come out and play!
Nishimiya,(Thoughts) So crass! Not cute at all.
[Scene: On the ground. Fushiguro is locked with Kamo. Maki is locked with Miwa.],
Fushiguro,"Kamo-san, are you guys planning to kill Itadori?"
Kamo,And if I said we were?
Fushiguro,"You failed, then. Itadori wouldn’t go down in such a short time."
[Action: Kamo jumps away from Fushiguro.],
Kamo,We have no reason to kill him.
Fushiguro,"Yes, you do. The higher-ups and the three major clans have plenty."
,
[Scene: Elsewhere in the forest. Itadori and Toudou are locked in battle.],
Itadori,Urah!
Toudou,Ngh!
Itadori,Ngh… Ngh…
Toudou,"Ngh… Ngh!

Urah!"
Itadori,Ngh… Urah! Ngh…
Toudou,Urahh!
[Action: Toudou kicks Itadori away.],
Itadori,Ngh… Urahh!
[Action: Itadori flips Toudou over.],
Itadori,Urah!
[Action: Toudou lands several punches to Itadori’s stomach.],
Itadori,Gah…
Toudou,Ngh!
Itadori,"Ugh!

Ngh… Urahh!"
"[Action: Itadori grabs onto a tree branch and spins around it, kicking toward Toudou. Toudou barely dodges the attack.]",
Toudou,"Woah!

(Thoughts) What splendid toughness! He’s actively using the landscape to his advantage, too!

Ah!

(Thoughts) He’s gone?"
Itadori,Urah!
[Action: Itadori lands a hard punch to the back of Toudou’s head.],
Toudou,(Thoughts) He’s so quick to set up his next move!
[Action: Toudou gets back up and spars with Itadori again.],
Itadori,Ugh… Ngh…
Toudou,"Ngh!

(Thoughts) And to top it all off…"
Itadori,Ngh!
[Action: Itadori punches Toudou in the face.],
Toudou,"Gah!

(Thoughts) … he has such tremendous power! His raw strength is greater than mine despite his small body! That’s why his blows are effective with so little cursed energy!

(Thoughts) And that makes it hard to read his movements from the flow of cursed energy!

(Thoughts) But the way this cursed energy hits after a time lag… That’s just… That’s just…

… wrong!"
[Action: Toudou’s voice echoes throughout the area.],
,
[Scene: Elsewhere in the forest. Maki and Miwa hear Toudou’s voice.],
Maki,Was that Toudou?
Miwa,It was.
Maki,"I think I understand why you failed to finish off Yuuji.

So why did you distance yourself from Noritoshi? Are you keeping your technique a secret from your allies, too?"
Miwa,"I’m sorry about Itadori-kun. I know this is an excuse, but I’m not like the others. Still, that doesn’t mean I plan to hand over victory in this Exchange Event.

You know that sorcerers advance in rank through a recommendation system, right?

The Exchange Event is often discussed among sorcerers without connections up the chain.

Students who perform well here are granted many chances to advance while they’re studying."
Ijichi,"Coincidentally, the person in charge of a student can’t recommend them. For example, Gojou-san couldn’t recommend Itadori-kun to be a first-grade."
Miwa,I want to become independent as quickly as possible so I can earn money.
Maki,Why?
[Action: Miwa draws her sword.],
Miwa,I’m poor! And I have two little brothers!
Maki,Are you okay? Are you getting along well enough with Mai? Aren’t you too nice of a person?
Miwa,Huh? Probably…
Maki,"I won’t hold back, you know."
Miwa,"Not a problem! That’s not what I said all that for, anyway!"
,
[Scene: Elsewhere in the forest. Toudou addresses Itadori.],
Toudou,My friend! That cursed energy you blast with a time lag… That’s a bad habit of yours!
Itadori,"You mean Divergent Fist?

(Thoughts) What’s he on about all of a sudden?"
Toudou,"So long as you’re satisfied with that, you’ll never beat me!

If you’re satisfied with staying on that level, you and I won’t stay best friends.

Are you okay with that?!"
Itadori,I don’t know. I don’t care about that.
Toudou,Are you okay with staying weak?!
Itadori,Ah…
[Action: Cursed energy flares in Itadori’s hand.],
Itadori,"No, I’m not!"
Toudou,"That’s right!

My best friend!"
Toudou,"(Thoughts) The hands will never surpass the eyes.

(Thoughts) Unless you cultivate the “eyes” to discern good from bad, you cannot hope to improve the “hands” that create works of art.

(Thoughts) It’s a phrase that’s often used among creators. However, it applies to all kinds of fields. Those with good “eyes” will improve far more rapidly than those without!"
[Scene: In the forest. Itadori charges at Toudou.],
Itadori,Ngh!
[Action: Itadori and Toudou become locked in combat.],
Itadori,Gah…
Toudou,Ngh…
Itadori,Ngh!
Toudou,Urahh!
Itadori,"Ngh…

Ngh… Ugh…"
Toudou,Ngh…
Itadori,Urahh!
[Action: Itadori punches Toudou in the mouth.],
Toudou,"(Thoughts) When I throw my right horizontal punch, he immediately sends a left vertical jab!

(Thoughts) Itadori wasn’t moving like that before! He’s improving… by devouring me!"
[Action: Itadori grabs Toudou and pushes him toward the ground.],
Itadori,Urah!
Toudou,(Thoughts) What a beautiful way to knock me down!
Itadori,(Thoughts) His face is wide open! I can hit it! Even with Divergent Fist!
Toudou,(Thoughts) However!
"[Action: Toudou gets up. Itadori hits him square in the forehead, but it does nothing.]",
Itadori,"Ah!

(Thoughts) He stopped my fist with his forehead before it could reach full speed?!"
Toudou,"That’s not what I want you to devour right now.

Your Divergent Fist is created by your cursed energy lagging behind your superhuman physical prowess when normally it would never lag.

It’s a tricky move. Your average sorcerer wouldn’t know what happened and would be left disoriented.

It carries plenty of force, too, for opponents on that level, at least!"
Itadori,Ah…
Toudou,"But it won’t work against special-grades.

What will you do, best friend?"
Itadori,Imbue my full strength with cursed energy at the right moment.
Toudou,Good! So then why is your cursed energy lagging? It’s because you’re channeling it!
Itadori,"Huh?

Wait, I thought we were talking about channeling it faster…"
Toudou,"We channel cursed energy. Many sorcerers do this consciously.

“My stomach is full of rage. The blood’s boiling in my gut.” The theory is that cursed energy extracted from such negative emotions starts in the navel and is channeled throughout the body.

They say it flows from the navel to the chest, then the shoulders, arms, and finally the fists, but this perception of the body as individual parts is what delays cursed energy."
Itadori,Ah…
Toudou,"The idea of channeling cursed energy isn’t wrong in itself. But that’s only the first step! You can’t let yourself remain too trapped by that concept. The better the sorcerer, the harder it is to read the flow of their cursed energy.

It’s for a different reason from why yours is.

Do we think with our guts? Do we express anger with our heads?

Listen to me, Itadori."
Itadori,Ah…
Toudou,"We exist in this world with our entire mind, body, and soul as one whole.

It’s such a given that everyone forgets about it."
Itadori,"Thanks, Toudou."
[Action: Cursed energy flows from Itadori’s whole body.],
Itadori,I think I get it now.
Toudou,Heh… Then no more words are needed.
[Action: Cursed energy flows from Toudou’s body.],
Toudou,"(Thoughts) I won’t hold back.

(Thoughts) I’ll guide you with my full strength!

(Thoughts) Don’t die on me, Itadori! Rise up to greater heights!"

[Scene: In the forest. Kugisaki calls up to Nishimiya.],
Kugisaki,"Hey, you. Your old fart told you to kill Itadori, right?"
Nishimiya,"Ngh…

(Thoughts) This girl has good intuition. No, that was probably Panda-chan.

Huh? What do you mean?"
Kugisaki,"You really don’t need to hide it. I’m out to kill someone, too. Especially that bitch Mai, the watered-down version of Maki."
Nishimiya,What?
Kugisaki,"Don’t “what” me. Even Pepper-kun gives slightly better responses than that.

(Thoughts) What, she’s not getting mad? But I feel the same way right now!

Oh, I almost forgot. You guys have your own Pepper-kun, huh? Maybe we’ll scrap it and dump it somewhere."
Nishimiya,Tsk…
Panda,"(Thoughts) Scary…

Ngh…"
[Action: Mechamaru fires a shot into Panda.],
Panda,Oh…
Kugisaki,Panda-senpai!
[Action: Panda falls to the ground.],
Mechamaru,"It’s a cursed corpse. It won’t die, though it won’t be able to move for a while.

Now, who were you calling a Pepper-kun?"
Nishimiya,"Hold on, Mechamaru."
[Action: Nishimiya comes down from the tree.],
Nishimiya,I’ll beat this first-year into cute shape. I’ll show her how Mai-chan’s suffered and teach her all about what it means for a woman to live as a jujutsu sorcerer.
[Action: Panda gets up.],
Panda,Just kidding.
Kugisaki,Huh?
Panda,Urah!
[Action: Panda charges at Mechamaru and punches it in the face.],
Panda,"You looking for attention? You should focus on support and staying hidden.

Well, let’s just get along since we’re so similar."
Mechamaru,Damn puppet…
Muta,What do you know?!
Panda,Good grief… What happened to hunting cursed spirits?
Mechamaru,Sword Option… Boost On.
[Action: Mechamaru launches toward Panda with an attack.],
Panda,Ah!
Mechamaru,Ultra Spin!
[Action: Mechamaru launches toward Panda. Panda dodges.],
Mechamaru,Can’t you keep still?
Panda,"(Thoughts) I need to finish this quickly. I’d rather leave him be and go help Nobara, but he fires at range. We didn’t have information on Mechamaru, Nishimiya, or Miwa, but…

You’re strong. What grade are you?

(Thoughts) … by my guess, this is where everyone stands. It’s a little too much for Nobara to handle."
Mechamaru,"I don’t think my rating against cursed spirits is needed right now, but I’ll tell you.

Semi-first-grade."
Panda,Huh?
Mechamaru,Ultra Cannon!
[Action: Mechamaru blasts an attack at Panda.],
Panda,(Thoughts) His area of attack is huge!
[Action: Panda absorbs the attack.],
Panda,"Phew…

(Thoughts) Heat emission! It’s a technique with big build-up and cooldown!"
Muta,(Thoughts) This output is pointless if I don’t hit its core dead-on.
Yaga,"(Flashback) Cursed corpses. That’s the generic name for inanimate objects that house curses and can operate independently.

(Flashback) Man-made cursed corpses always have a core that serves as their heart.

(Flashback) Panda is the ultimate masterpiece by myself, Yaga Masamichi, the leading expert on puppeteering cursed techniques. He’s a cursed corpse born with emotions.

(Flashback) He’s a cursed corpse mutation! Panda… is not a panda!"
[Action: Panda punches Mechamaru in the face.],
Panda,Ora ora ora ora!
Muta,(Thoughts) I can’t follow his movements!
Panda,"Ora!

Ngh!

Urahh!

There!"
"[Action: Panda smacks Mechamaru with his behind, sending him flying.]",
Panda,"I guess if there was another like me, I would have at least heard rumors.

The fact that I haven’t means you’re not a cursed corpse but a sorcerer who’s remote-controlling this thing while your main body’s elsewhere. That doesn’t mean you should snap over being treated like a cursed corpse. You don’t like being similar to me?

You wound me. I think it actually hurts!

Judging from your cursed energy output, your main body shouldn’t be that far away. No, you’re just outside the arena, huh? Guess there’s no point in hunting you down, then. You’d just be free to act in the meantime, so I guess I’ll just bust you up."
Mechamaru,"You won’t be doing either.

Have you ever heard of…"
Muta,"… a Heavenly Pact?

It’s not like a pact normally forged with oneself. It’s a pact forced upon the body from the moment it’s born. I was born without a right arm or anything below my knees, and I had no sensation from the waist down.

My skin is so fragile that even moonlight burns it, and it constantly feels like needles are stabbing every pore of my body."
Mechamaru,"But in exchange, I’ve been granted the ability to use cursed techniques over vast distances as well as immense cursed energy production."
Muta,"I didn’t ask for any of this power. If I could trade my cursed techniques to have a normal body, I’d gladly do so."
Mechamaru,"So when I see a cursed corpse like you walking around in broad daylight without a care instead of me, I just cannot stand it!

Ultimate Mechamaru!

Mode: Albatross!"
Panda,"(Thoughts) That’s an incredible amount of cursed energy! And given his position, Nobara’s in his line of fire! I have to block it!"
Mechamaru,Ultimate Cannon!
[Action: Mechamaru fires a blast of cursed energy at Panda.],
Mechamaru,"Is it dead? No, the very concept of death doesn’t apply to you."
[Action: Mechamaru begins to walk away.],
Panda,"You revealed your technique while boasting about your misfortune, then. Quite the sorcerer thing to do."
Muta,(Thoughts) It’s still alive after taking a hit from Ultimate Cannon?
[Action: Panda emerges in his gorilla form.],
Panda,I’m kind of pissed now.
Mechamaru,What is that form?
Yaga,(Flashback) Panda… is not a panda!
,
,
,
[Scene: In the past. A young Panda plays with blocks.],
Yaga,"(Flashback) Panda.

(Flashback) You have an older brother and an older sister."
Y.Panda,"(Flashback) No, I do not."
Yaga,"(Flashback) Yes, you do. They’re inside you. And why the polite tone?"
Y.Panda,(Flashback) Inside me?
Yaga,"(Flashback) Yes. You’ll understand someday.

(Flashback) Those two will always, always lend you strength."
[Scene: In the present. Panda charges at Mechamaru.],
Mechamaru,Sword Option: Ultra Shield!
Panda,Urahh!
[Action: Panda breaks through Mechamaru’s shield and sends him flying.],
Mechamaru,Ngh…
Panda,"(Thoughts) Normally, a cursed corpse has a single core for its heart, but there are three cores inside me, and by switching out which one is the main core, I can convert my body.

(Thoughts) There’s the Panda core, focused on balance, my older brother, Gorilla Core, focused on power for short, decisive battles… and my bashful older sister.

(Thoughts) His first attack got my older sister’s core, and that last one exhausted the Panda core.

(Thoughts) I have no choice left but to beat him with Gorilla Mode!"
[Action: Mechamaru gets blasted onto the rooftop of a building.],
Muta,"(Thoughts) He doesn’t pack as much power as Toudou, but that palm strike just now went all the way to my internals.

(Thoughts) Even if I guard, I’ll still take damage."
Panda,Have you realized it?
Mechamaru,Ah…
Panda,This is Gorilla Mode’s special move… the unstoppable Drumming Beat!
Muta,"(Thoughts) If I take that Drumming Beat to my head or chest, I won’t be able to move Mechamaru anymore.

(Thoughts) My right arm, Sword Option, is no longer functioning. I can’t fire Ultimate Cannon anymore, either!"
Panda,"(Thoughts) Gorilla Mode pounds through cursed energy like a gorilla. I need to hurry.

(Thoughts) I crushed his right arm. He can’t fire off his ultimate attack anymore. No swords in his left or his mouth, so only ranged blasts left? Even so, he shouldn’t fire them haphazardly.

(Thoughts) Mechamaru believes he failed to finish me with those blasts twice already, despite actually putting two of my cores close to death. This time, he’ll likely blast my core with point-blank precision or try to finish me with a slash. However…"
[Action: Panda jumps onto the roof.],
Panda,"(Thoughts) … I have the advantage at close range!

Ngh!"
[Action: Panda and Mechamaru charge at each other.],
Panda,"Urahh! Ngh… Urahh! Urahh!

Urahhh!"
Mechamaru,Ngh…
[Action: Mechamaru dodges Panda’s attacks and grabs onto Panda with its legs.],
Panda,Grr… Urgh!
[Action: Mechamaru blasts Panda away with a series of blasts. Panda continues to chase after Mechamaru.],
Panda,"Ngh!

Ngh! Urahh! Urahh!

Ngh! Urahh!

Urahh!"
"[Action: Panda punches at Mechamaru, but Mechamaru vaults over him in the air.]",
Panda,"Ngh! Grr…

Urahh! Ngh… Ngh… Urahh!

Ngh… Urah!"
Mechamaru,Ngh!
[Action: Mechamaru throws a roof tile at Panda.],
Panda,(Thoughts) A tile? Did he pick it off the roof just now?
"[Action: Mechamaru kicks the tile, shattering it in Panda’s face.]",
Panda,Urgh!
[Action: Mechamaru flies past Panda with a jet.],
Panda,(Thoughts) A distraction and then jet acceleration? He’s experienced at this!
Muta,"(Thoughts) This time, I won’t miss!

(Thoughts) Its core is where its cursed energy is densest! Right here!"
[Action: Mechamaru punches Panda in his side.],
Panda,Ugh…
Mechamaru,You did well for a puppet.
[Action: Panda grabs Mechamaru’s arm.],
Panda,Ngh!
Mechamaru,Ah…
Panda,"Don’t treat me like other cursed corpses. I know how to bluff the position of my core with cursed energy manipulation.

(Thoughts) I’m already concealing the number of cores, anyway."
[Action: Panda crushes Mechamaru’s face.],
Mechamaru,Ngh!
Panda,Urah!
[Action: Panda rips Mechamaru’s arm off and tosses its body away.],
Panda,"You lost because you underestimated puppets!

I haven’t had a single thing in common with anyone around me from the moment I was born. I thought you and I could understand each other in that sense.

Though I’ve never once been jealous of humans."
Muta,What?
Panda,"I mean, humans are creepy, you know?"
Muta,Erk!
Panda,"They’ll risk their lives and fight hard toward their goals, then they’ll be laidback or wishy-washy. I don’t get it.

Still, I do love those aspects that I don’t have, creepy as they are."
[Action: Panda returns to his normal form.],
Panda,"I’m sure you have your own hardships, too, Mechamaru. But having more hardships doesn’t make you right. I mean, it’s not like we’re enemies in the first place.

Why are you a jujutsu sorcerer to begin with? Because that’s the only thing you can do? I mean, not that it really matters.

But if you want to make something happen, I’ll help you."
Muta,Ngh…
Kamo,(Flashback) Mechamaru… Don’t waste your powerful moves. You never know when you’ll be facing more than a single enemy before you.
Toudou,"(Flashback) Mechamaru, don’t go thinking someone who can’t instantly state his type of woman can become a full-fledged jujutsu sorcerer."
Miwa,"(Flashback) Mechamaru, it’s just obligatory, but I got you these instead of chocolates. I heard you liked AA Evoltas."
Mechamaru,(Flashback) I’m not like that.
Miwa,(Flashback) Huh? What?
"Mai, Nishimiya",(Flashback) Hahahaha!
Miwa,(Flashback) But Mai said so!
Muta,One day… together… with everyone…
Panda,Hm? Say that again?
Mechamaru,I wonder if you’ll still say you’ll help me after seeing what I look like.
Panda,"Huh? Fufufufu! You think I’m going to fuss over what you look like? I’m a panda.

Later. Let me pay you a visit next time."
[Action: Panda walks away from Mechamaru.],
Muta,"Shut up, you damn puppet.

Ngh…"
Panda,I forgot!
Mechamaru,Huh?
Panda,Lend me your phone.
,
[Scene: Elsewhere in the forest. Maki engages in battle with Miwa.],
Maki,"Ngh!

Hah!"
Miwa,(Thoughts) No way… This woman is incredibly strong!
